## Start With Why

As of January 26th, 2018, I subscribe to 308 podcasts. I found them by searching keywords, exploring charts, and listening to recommendations from friends, subreddits, and tweets. But I haven't found a service that recommends podcasts that I wouldn't have already found on my own.

Where is the podcast industry's version of [Spotify's Discover Weekly](https://gizmodo.com/spotifys-new-discover-weekly-playlist-knows-you-so-we-1718992287)? I don't know, but this is my attempt to create one.

**I have one goal for this project**: Create an algorithm that finds me at least one incredible podcast that I wouldn't have found otherwise.
