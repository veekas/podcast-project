And he s recently back from a trip to North Korea, where he learned how Trump s threats are playing in one of the strangest and most sealed-off regimes on earth.  To go between Washington and Pyongyang at this nuclear moment is to be struck, most of all, by how little the two understand each other,   he wrote.  In eighteen years of reporting, I ve never felt as much uncertainty at the end of a project, a feeling that nobody—not the diplomats, the strategists, or the scholars who have devoted their lives to the subject—is able to describe with confidence how the other side thinks.   In this discussion, Osnos and I talk about that trip: about what North Korea is like, what they think about us, and what war with them would actually mean. We also talk about China — they literally can t believe their luck with Donald Trump, he says — and whether the widespread rumors that Trump is facing some kind of mental deterioration are true. Osnos, who dove deep into the subject for a New Yorker article on the 25th Amendment, fears they are. And that s not all: We dig into the pressures for war in Washington, the tendency toward survivalism in Silicon Valley, and why Osnos finds his best article subjects by looking at some of the worst things that could possibly happen to the human race.

That s James Wallner s argument, and it s more persuasive than you might think. Wallner is a political scientist who became a top Republican Senate aide, working as legislative director for Senators Jeff Sessions and Pat Toomey, as well as executive director of the Senate Steering Committee under Toomey and Lee. He s now a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, and the author of  The Death of Deliberation: Partisanship and Polarization in the United States Senate.   Wallner is immersed in congressional history and procedure, and one of his conclusions after years of both study and experience is that the leadership in both parties are using the rules to stymie disagreement and suppress chaos — and well-intentioned though this might be, it s making everything worse. Congress, Wallner believes, is an institution designed to surface conflict so that positions can be made clear, compromises can be tested, and a way forward can be found. That s not happening now, and the results are disastrous. The Republican Party is particularly bad on this score, he says.  They pretend like they all agree on everything...But if you never deal with your problems, what do you think happens? A break-up! And that's literally what you're seeing right now.

      "description": "  It s important to remember the inconsequence of one s talent and hard work and the incredible and unmatched sway of luck and fate,   writes Ta-Nehisi Coates in his new book, We Were Eight Years in Power . Coates s view of his career flows from his view of human events: contingent, unguided, and devoid of higher morality or cosmic justice. He is not here to comfort you. He is not here to comfort himself. Nothing in the record of human history argues for a divine morality, and a great deal argues against it, he writes. What we know is that good people very often suffer terribly, while the perpetrators of horrific evil backstroke through all the pleasures of the world. It s this worldview that makes conversations with Coates so bracing. His philosophy leaves room for chaos, for disorder, for things to go terribly wrong and stay that way. In this discussion, I asked him what would make him hopeful, what it would mean for America to live up to its ideals.  Closing the 20-to-1 white-black wealth gap, he replied. But what would that take, he asked?  Maybe something so large that you find yourself in a country that's not even America anymore.    Maybe, he mused, it s something that he couldn t even support. It's very easy for me to see myself being contemporary with processes that might make for an equal world, more equality, and maybe the complete abolition of race as a construct, and being horrified by the process, maybe even attacking the process. I think these things don't tend to happen peacefully.  This is a discussion about race, about luck, about history, about politics, but above all, about how the stories we tell ourselves are often designed to carry comfort rather than truth. For me, my part in this struggle, my part to make a better world, is not simply to have people pick up my work and say, 'Well, all the facts seem correct. I think this is right,' and, then move on with their lives, says Coates. My job is to bring across the emotion, to make them feel a certain way, to haunt them, to make it hard to sleep. ",

As Ta-Nehisi Coates began his book tour for We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy, he had a telling exchange with The Late Show's Stephen Colbert. You've had a hard time in some interviews expressing a sense of hope in this country,   Colbert said. Do you have any hope tonight for the people out there, about how we could be a better country, we could have better race relations, we could have better politics?   No,   Coates replied. But I'm not the person you should go to for that. You should go to your pastor. Your pastor provides you hope. Your friends provide you hope.   This wasn't the answer Colbert was looking for. I'm not asking you to make shit up,   he said. I'm asking if you personally see any evidence for change in America.   But I would have to make shit up to actually answer that question in a satisfying way,   Coates shot back. Colbert is not alone in his request, or in his frustration. It speaks to the quasi-prophetic space Coates occupies in American life that his pessimism grates so deeply on so many, that the central struggle over his work is not its rightness, or its righteousness, but whether it leaves too little space for sunbeams. Coates freely admits that he owes his career to Barack Obama s political rise, to perhaps the most optimistic politician in American life, and yet he refuses to pledge allegiance to hope or place any confidence in change. Indeed, his understanding of those terms puts him at odds with the American consensus. We Were Eight Years in Power is an unusual book. It collects nine of Coates s Atlantic essays, one from each year of Obama s presidency, and one from its savage aftermath. Connecting the essays are lyrical, autobiographical reflections that situate the work in Coates s daily life, that track his steady evolution as a writer and a thinker. The most interesting thread of these reflections traces Coates s slow loss of hope, the rising recognition, long before Donald Trump won power, that Obama s presidency would not have a happy ending. The question Coates poses, to himself and to us, is this: What does it mean to be hopeful about race in America? There was a time when Coates believed in hope and change, or at least wanted to believe in it. It was hard not to reassess yourself at, say, the sight of John Patterson, the man who d out-niggered George Wallace to become governor of Alabama in 1959, endorsing Obama, he writes. But then, in quick succession, came Shirley Sherrod, and the humiliation of the beer summit, and the reaffirmation, for Coates, of the great power of white innocence — the need to believe that whatever might befall the country, white America is ultimately blameless. Coates is not a writer who grasps for easy answers. He does not condemn Obama for firing Sherrod, or for placating the police officer who had arrested Henry Louis Gates Jr. on his own porch by inviting him for a drink in the Rose Garden. Obama was the first black president of a majority-white country,   he writes. He should ve feared white innocence! Everything had changed, and not enough had changed. It is in moments like these that you see Coates diverge from his critics. There are two ways of looking at the beer summit. It took place on the lawn of the White House, and the occupant of the White House was black. Hope. But even a black president of the United States still had to genuflect before white America s fear of black men, and its insistence that that fear is innocent and valid. Despair. Americans venerate progress. Our national mythos is of a perfecting union, a country always striving to come closer to its ideals. To deny that there is hope is to deny that America is getting steadily better, and it is folly to deny that America is a better, fairer, more just country today than it was 50 years ago, or 100 years ago. This is the position of Coates s critics: There is progress, and therefore there is hope. This is what Colbert asked for when he asked for hope: evidence that we could be better, that we were becoming better. This is what New York magazine's Jonathan Chait accused Coates of missing, saying he defines out of existence the very possibility of steady progress.   Reading Coates, I do not believe hope, for him, is synonymous with progress. Hope is prediction. It is about ultimate levels, not current trends. To be hopeful about race in America is not to say that slowly things will become less bad. It is to say that they will become good, equal, just. To be hopeful is to believe that America will one day embody its ideals, that it will atone for its past. Coates quotes Malcolm X, who said, You don t stick a knife in a man s back nine inches and then pull it out six inches and say you re making progress. There is a paragraph in Coates s book that I have read and reread. It is, to me, the clearest distillation of his worldview and its power. I do not think there is any doubt that this paragraph is true. I also do not think it is possible to live inside its truth and feel very hopeful: Any fair consideration of the depth and width of enslavement tempts insanity. First conjure the crime — the generational destruction of human bodies — and all of its related offenses — domestic terrorism, poll taxes, mass incarceration. But then try to imagine being an individual born among the remnants of that crime, among the wronged, among the plundered, and feeling the gravity of that crime all around and seeing it in the sideways glances of the perpetrators of that crime and overhearing it in their whispers and watching these people, at best, denying their power to address this crime and, at worst, denying that any crime had occurred at all, even as their entire lives revolve around the fact of a robbery so large that it is written in our very names. Though America may improve, its debts will never be repaid, its ideals will never be reached, the barest definition of justice will never be attained. It was, Coates says, his seminal article on reparations that crystallized this knowledge. The reparations claim was so old, so transparently correct, so clearly the only solution, and yet it remained far outside the borders of American politics. To believe anything else was to believe that a robbery spanning generations could somehow be ameliorated while never acknowledging the scope of the crime and never making recompense. And yet that was the thinking that occupied mainstream American politics. Here, again, you see Coates s insistence that mere progress cannot be the measure of hope. He had written an Atlantic cover story that set the entire country talking about reparations, that forced at least an intellectual reckoning with the idea and its unsparing logic. The article made him a celebrity, a public intellectual. That's progress, and for many, that would be hope. But no matter how sound his argument, reparations were no likelier to come to fruition the day after he published his article than the day before. Progress isn't enough. For Coates, progress can, and likely will, coexist with deep injustice and a society ordered around, and constantly rationalizing, its crimes. The villains will not be punished, and the victims, many of them dead, will never be made whole. This is not just American truth. It is a cosmic truth, seen across nations and across times. Nothing in the record of human history argues for a divine morality, and a great deal argues against it, he writes. What we know is that good people very often suffer terribly, while the perpetrators of horrific evil backstroke through all the pleasures of the world. Last week, I interviewed Coates for my podcast. I asked him to describe the world in which justice had been done, in which equality had been achieved, in which hope was merited. We have a 20-to-1 wealth gap, Coates replied. Every nickel of wealth the average black family has, the average white family has a dollar. What is the world in which that wealth gap is closed? What happens? What makes that possible? What does that look like? What is the process? Even imagining that world, Coates makes ample space for tragedy. When he tries to describe the events that would erase America s wealth gap, that would see the end of white supremacy, his thoughts flicker to the French Revolution, to the executions and the terror. It s very easy for me to see myself being contemporary with processes that might make for an equal world, more equality, and maybe the complete abolition of race as a construct, and being horrified by the process, maybe even attacking the process. I think these things don t tend to happen peacefully. For Coates, even hope can be covered in blood.",

The vision was idea-driven: tax policy that helped the middle class, healthcare ideas that would mean more insurance for more people, and a generalized effort to remake the safety net to support modern families. In 2016, Donald Trump managed to make the Republican Party more popular among working class whites. But he didn t do it the way Salam hoped. Today, Salam is executive editor at the National Review, and he s trying to puzzle his way towards a new synthesis on the questions fracturing American politics. In this episode, we talk about the future of the Republican Party, the healthcare debate, and how he would reform our immigration system (and upend the whole way we talk about it).

Under his leadership, the New Yorker has received 149 nominations for National Magazine Awards and won 37. It s also, perhaps more impressively, been consistently profitable in an era where many august journalism organizations have seen their business models collapse. And Remnick keeps writing. He s the author of six books, including Lenin s Tomb , which won a Pulitzer Prize, and The Bridge , a fascinating biography of Barack Obama, and he churns out a steady stream of deeply reported profiles of musicians, athletes, and politicians. Oh, and he hosts the New Yorker Radio Hour . He s a busy guy. Remnick started his career as a beat reporter at the Washington Post. In 1988, the Post sent him to Moscow, an auspicious time for a young reporter to land in what was then the Soviet Union. There, he witnessed the fall of the USSR and the creation of modern Russia — a journalistic background that has become startlingly relevant in recent years. In this wide-ranging discussion, the New Yorker editor discusses Russia s meddling in the US election, Russia s transformation from communist rule to Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin, his magazine s coverage of President Donald Trump, how he chooses his reporters and editors, and how to build a real business around great journalism. Whether you care about politics or journalism or just the role of truth in society today, there's a lot of wisdom here.

      "description": " On page 239 of What Happened , Hillary Clinton reveals that she almost ran a very different campaign in 2016. Before announcing for president, she read Peter Barnes s book With Liberty and Dividends for All , and became fascinated by the idea of using revenue from shared natural resources, like fossil fuel extraction and public airwaves, alongside revenue from taxing public harms, like carbon emissions and risky financial practices, to give every American  a modest basic income.   Her ambitions for this idea were expansive, touching on not just the country s economic ills but its political and spiritual ones.  Besides cash in people s pockets,   she writes,  it would be also be a way of making every American feel more connected to our country and to each other.   This is the kind of transformative vision that Clinton was often criticized for not having. It s an idea bigger than a wall, perhaps bigger even than single-payer health care or free college. But she couldn t make the numbers work. Every version of the plan she tried either raised taxes too high or slashed essential programs. So she scrapped it.  That was the responsible decision,   she writes. But after the 2016 election, Clinton is no longer sure that  responsible   is the right litmus test for campaign rhetoric.  I wonder now whether we should ve thrown caution to the wind, embraced [it] as a long-term goal and figured out the details later,   she writes. What Happened has been sold as Clinton s apologia for her 2016 campaign, and it is that. But it s more remarkable for Clinton s extended defense of a political style that has become unfashionable in both the Republican and Democratic parties. Clinton is not a radical or a revolutionary, a disruptor or a socialist, and she s proud of that fact. She s a pragmatist who believes in working within the system, in promising roughly what you believe you can deliver, in saying how you ll pay for your plans. She is frustrated by a polity that doesn t share her  thrill   over incremental policies that help real people or her skepticism of sweeping plans that will never come to fruition. She believes in politics the way it is actually practiced, and she holds to that belief at a moment when it s never been less popular. This makes Clinton a more unusual figure than she gets credit for being: Not only does she refuse to paint an inspiring vision of a political process rid of corruption, partisanship, and rancor, but she s also actively dismissive of those promises and the politicians who make them. On Tuesday morning, I sat down with Clinton for an hour on the first official day of her book tour. It is a cliché that stiff candidates become freer, easier, and more confident after they lose — see Gore, Al — but it is true for Clinton. Jon Stewart used to talk of the  buffering   you could see happening in the milliseconds between when Clinton was asked a question and when she answered; the moments when she played out the angles, envisioned the ways her words could be twisted, and came up with a response devoid of danger but suffused with caution. That buffering is gone. In our conversation, she was as quick and confident as I ve seen her, making the case for her politics without worrying too much about the coalitional angles or the possible lines of offense. And she says plenty that can, and will, offend. In our discussion, she lit into Bernie Sanders s single-payer plan, warned that Donald Trump is dragging us down an authoritarian path, spoke openly of the role racism and white resentment played in the campaign, and argued that the outcome of the 2016 election represented a failure of the media above all. This was Clinton unleashed, and while she talked about what happened, it was much more interesting when she talked about what she believed should have happened. ",

We cover a lot of ground in this podcast, looking at everything from disparities in crime rates to sentencing to policing.

      "description": " Michael Bennet is an accidental senator. He was unexpectedly appointed to fill an open seat after Ken Salazar joined the Obama administration. He had never run for elected office before, or served in a legislative body. Perhaps that s why he s always, in my experience, been appropriately shocked by how the US Congress actually works. Since joining the Senate (and winning reelection in 2010 and 2016), Bennet has become one of its more effective members. He was part of the Gang of Eight that authored the immigration reform plan that passed the body, and he s known for working well with both Republicans and Democrats. And yet, he is despairing over the state of the institution in which he serves. This is a conversation about why Congress is broken, and what broke it. We discuss money, partisanship, the media, the rules, the leadership, and much more. We talk about what Bennet thinks House of Cards gets right (hint: it s the sociopathy) and whether President Trump s antics are creating some hope of institutional renewal. There s a lot of good stuff in this conversation, and I don t want to spoil it. Suffice to say, if you care about the US Congress in this age — and you should — this is a discussion worth hearing.

      "description": " Yascha Mounk is a lecturer at Harvard, a columnist at Slate, and the host of The Good Fight podcast. He s also an expert on how democracies backslide into illiberalism — which was the topic of our first conversation on this podcast. But when Mounk and I last spoke, fears of Trump s illiberal instincts seemed to have been overblown. This was an administration too incompetent to be authoritarian. But Mounk made a prediction then that has, I think, been borne out: Trump s illiberal instincts would be catalyzed by his failures, not his successes. As Trump finds himself frustrated by Congress, and by the FBI investigation, and by Robert Mueller s inquiry, and by White House leakers, he lashes out at the system he thinks is unfairly, even dangerously, constraining him. Of late, Trump s illiberalism has made a comeback — he s giving speeches calling for more police brutality, he fired an FBI director who threatened him, he s attacking his own attorney general for doing too little to shield him from investigation, he s demanding vast changes to congressional rules, he s calling for administration lawyers to begin exploring the reach of his pardon powers, and he's running a White House where the clear guiding principle is loyalty to Trump rather than loyalty to country. But as Mounk and I discuss in this podcast, that s not the scary part. The scary part isn t Trump s illiberalism but the political system s acceptance of it. If you had read off Trump s list of offenses as a hypothetical 12 months ago, you would ve been told that neither Congress nor the public would allow any of this to go unpunished. But Trump remains around 40 percent in the polls and his support among congressional Republicans has barely wavered. This is a lesson that goes far beyond Trump: We re learning that American politics is much more vulnerable to, and much less offended by, leaders who want to subvert the rule of law than we thought. It may be that Trump is too impulsive and short-tempered to take advantage of that fact. But will that be true of his successors, too? As you ll hear in this podcast, as Mounk and I were discussing that question, we got news that Trump had fired his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and replaced him with Gen. John Kelly. You ll get to hear us react to that in real time.   ",

Arguments where the points being made do not describe, or influence, the positions being held. Arguments that leave everyone dumber, angrier, sadder. Which is why I wanted to talk to Julia Galef this week. Julia is the host of the Rationally Speaking podcast, a co-founder of the Center for Applied Rationality, and the creator of the Update Project, which maps out arguments to make it easier for people to disagree clearly and productively. Her work focuses on how we think and argue, as well as the cognitive biases and traps that keep us from hearing what we're really saying, hearing what others are really saying, and preferring answers that make us feel good to answers that are true. I first met her at a Vox Conversation conference, where she ran a session helping people learn to change their minds, and it's struck me since then that more of us could probably use that training. In this episode, Julia and I talk about what she's learned about thinking more clearly and arguing better, as well as my concerns that the traditional paths toward a better discourse open up new traps of their own. (As you'll hear, I find it very easy to get lost in all the ways debate and cognition can go awry.) We talk about signaling, about motivated reasoning, about probabilistic debating, about which identities help us find truth, and about how to make online arguments less terrible.

On the bright side? Massive tax cuts for the rich. It s not a widely popular vision — the bill is struggling to attract Republican support, and is polling between 12 and 17 percent. But it does have defenders. Chief among them is Avik Roy, a past guest on this podcast and the co-founder of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity. The bill s passage, Roy said, would be the greatest policy achievement by a GOP Congress in my lifetime.   I am, to say the least, not a fan of this legislation. So I asked Roy to return to the podcast to discuss it. I wanted to hear the best possible case for the bill. In this conversation, we discuss the Better Care Reconciliation Act, but also the broader health care philosophies that fracture the right. We talk about Roy s disagreements with the CBO s methodology, as well as the many, many ways he thinks the Senate bill needs to improve. We talk about the ways the GOP has moved left on health care policy without coming to a consensus about what the policy is meant to accomplish. We talk about Medicaid, about welfare reform, and about how policymakers should think about the needy who are hard to help. We talk about the many ways the American health care system subsidizes the rich, and the way that money could be better used. Roy, I would say, is a lot more enthusiastic about the Senate bill in theory than in practice. After this discussion, I better understood why he sees the bill as a victory for Republicans who want their party to embrace universal health care, but I left thinking he was underrating the dangers of a party that isn t united behind that vision implementing legislation like this. We discuss that, too. If you want to understand the GOP s internal dynamics on health care, listen to this conversation. I cover this stuff for a living, and I learned a lot. ",

And it has a tendency to mirror and magnify the issues that affect everyday life.  boyd is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research, the founder of Data &amp; Society, a visiting professor at New York University, and a fantastically interesting thinker. She packs more insight into a blog post than many authors get into a book. I ve been reading her and learning from her for a long time, so I ve been looking forward to this discussion, and it didn t disappoint.In this conversation, we discuss why fake news is so easy to believe, digital white flight, how an anthropologist studies social media, the reasons machine learning algorithms reflect our prejudices rather than fixing them, what Netflix initially got wrong about their recommendations engine, the value of pretending your audience is only six people, the early utopian visions of the internet, and so, so much more.

And note that I said interesting, not funny (though it is also funny).Most books by politicians are about how they re not really politicians — they re authentic, they re honest, they shoot from the hip, they still remember what it was like growing up in a mill town raised by feral dogs and subsisting on nothing but hay.Franken s book is the opposite: It s the story of how he learned to be a politician, and even how he learned to respect politicians. It s about realizing he couldn t litigate his past comedy, about trusting his staff, about understanding why politicians act the way they do in interviews, about recognizing why the norms of the Senate matter.So this is an interview about what it s like to be a politician, why perfectly nice and interesting people end up acting like all those other politicians after getting elected, and the role we as voters (and we in the media) play in it.

It s those smug cosmopolitans who led to Donald Trump s election. It s those rootless cosmopolitans who re shipping jobs overseas with no thought for their home communities. Cosmopolitans. Ick. Kwame Anthony Appiah is a British-born Ghanaian-American philosopher at New York University, as well the writer of the New York Times Magazine s  Ethicist   column. He s also the author of the wonderful book Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers. And this is a conversation I ve been wanting to have with him for a long time.  For most of human history, we were born into small societies of a few score people, bands of hunters and gatherers, and would see, on a typical day, only people we had known most of our lives,   Appiah writes.  Everything our long-ago ancestors ate or wore, every tool they used, every shrine at which they worshipped, was made within that group. Their knowledge came from their ancestors or from their own experiences. That is the world that shaped us, the world in which our nature was formed.   Now, if I walk down New York s Fifth Avenue on an ordinary day, I will have within sight more human beings than most of those prehistoric hunter-gatherers saw in a lifetime.  This, Appiah says, is the challenge we face today: how to live in a world much larger and more diverse than the one we were built for. The answer, he argues, is an ethic of cosmopolitanism — an ethic that honors our moral obligations to each other even as we recognize and respect the differences between us.In this podcast, we dive deep into Appiah s philosophy of cosmopolitanism. What do we owe a Syrian refugee? How much more should the lives of our neighbors mean to us than the lives of those in foreign lands? When is difference something to be celebrated, and when is it something to be battled? And how did the term  cosmopolitan   become such a slur anyway?We also discuss the controversy in philosophy circles over Rebecca Tuvel s essay on  transracial   identity, what Appiah has learned as the Ethicist, the moral quandary facing Trump staffers who want to make things better from the inside but realize that means becoming complicit in what s done, and more.

He was also a guest on my podcast recently; it was one of the more remarkable conversations I ve been privileged to have. Today I m posting an excerpt of our discussion that s particularly relevant amid the renewed debate over New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu trying to tear down Confederate monuments across his city. These monuments celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy, ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, ignoring the terror that it actually stood for, 'Landrieu said. In response, Mississippi state Rep.Karl Oliver wrote that those statues were erected in the loving memory of our family and fellow Southern Americans, 'and if Landrieu, and the lawmakers supporting his plan, want to destroy historical monuments of OUR HISTORY, they should be LYNCHED!'Oliver later apologized for using the word lynched, but the fight is a reminder that America in 2017 is still deeply, even violently, divided over the legacy of slavery, and those who fought to defend it. None of this surprises Stevenson.For years, his organization has been documenting and memorializing the actual lynchings that happened in America after slavery was abolished, and is now building a museum that will explore America s brutal history on race with more honesty.He has thought deeply about the work America resistance to confronting the reality of our past, and the damage that that national act of forgetting— or, worse, of lying— has done to our present. We ve created the counternarrative that says we have nothing about which we should be ashamed,' says Stevenson. Our past is romantic and glorious. In my state of Alabama, Jefferson Davis s birthday is a state holiday.Confederate Memorial Day is a state holiday.We don t even have Martin Luther King Day in Alabama. We have Martin Luther King/Robert E. Lee Day. Our two largest high schools are Robert E. Lee High and Jefferson Davis High. They re both 90 - some percent African - American.If we don t think it matters, then I think we re just kidding ourselves.' This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.For our whole discussion— which includes much more on the death penalty, the drug war, the trauma communities go through when the innocent are imprisoned, and more— subscribe to The Ezra Klein Show wherever you get your podcasts, or stream it on SoundCloud. Ezra Klein You often say that the opposite of poverty is not wealth.The opposite of poverty is justice.'What do you mean by that ? Bryan Stevenson The wealth of the colonies was built on genocide of removing Native Americans from lands that they occupied.We kept their names, but we made them leave.We didn t really acknowledge the injustice of that because we were persuaded that our economic security and our political development require the acquisition of these lands.It began this way of thinking about wealth that is disconnected from the oppression that is sometimes used to create that wealth.And that habit was reinforced through slavery. We created great wealth in new territories in the south and the colonies by relying on enslaved people and the labor and the benefits that that created without any real thinking about how that wealth was sustained by abuse and oppression and inequality and injustice. This idea has emerged in America that wealth is created by people with great talent and great ability.We value wealth.We respect wealth.We admire wealth.We disdain the poor.We blame the poor.We fault the poor for not achieving more economic security. For me, it s important to redefine what it is we are dealing with when we deal with poverty, and that definition begins with recognizing that the opposite of poverty isn t wealth.The opposite of poverty is justice.If we actually had been just to those communities that we removed from the land, if we had been just to the formally enslaved, if we d been just to immigrants who came and gave great wealth, we would actually be in a very different place when it comes to dealing with structural poverty. Ezra Klein But the idea of what represents justice is deeply contested.When you ask whether descendants of slave owners owe the communities they enslaved anything, you get a lot of disagreement.And there s huge resistance when the definition of justice would require the bearing of shame, much less reparations or some other kind of recompense. Bryan Stevenson There are narratives we have that we rely on to feel comfortable with the status quo.I mean, the people who came to this country as settlers didn t think of themselves as inhumane or barbaric or killers or mass murderers. They just didn t see the native people that they forced off their land as fully human.They said those people were savages.They used that narrative of racial difference to justify their comfort.We used that same narrative of racial difference to justify centuries of enslavement. I actually think the great evil of American slavery wasn t involuntary servitude and forced labor. The true evil of American slavery was the narrative we created to justify it. They made up this ideology of white supremacy that cannot be reconciled with our Constitution, that cannot be reconciled with a commitment to fair and just treatment of all people. They made it up so they could feel comfortable while enslaving other people. I really believe that narrative was the true evil, and it s the thing that didn t get abolished in 1865. If you read the 13 th Amendment, it talks about ending involuntary servitude and forced labor, but it doesn t say anything about the narrative of racial difference, the ideology of white supremacy. Because of that, I ve argued that slavery didn t end in 1865; it just evolved. We had decades of terrorism and violence and lynching. The North won the Civil War, but the South won the narrative war. There was no actual accountability. There was no reckoning. There was no acknowledgment that slavery was wrong at some fundamental level. The failure of that transition means that even today, we re dealing with a narrative of racial difference. My work is aimed at trying to confront the burdens that people of color in this country face, which are heavily organized around presumption of dangerousness and guilt. It doesn t matter how educated you are, it doesn t matter how many degrees you have — you will go places in this country if you re a person of color and you will be presumed dangerous or guilty, and you re going to have to overcome that presumption. As I get older, I can tell you that that weight starts to feel heavy.You start to feel overwhelmed by constantly having to navigate people s perceptions of you. Even though I m a practicing lawyer, I still have to overcome that presumption frequently.I just don t think we re going to be free until we do something about these narratives, and that s why they re the heart of it for me. Ezra Klein I want to talk a bit about the way the South won that narrative.When I drive into Virginia, I drive on highways named for Confederate leaders.I drive by buildings named for Confederate leaders.You ve spoken about the difference between what the United States memorializes in its built environment and what other countries that have had a history of shameful violence and oppression memorialize in their built environments— what does that difference means for our collective consciousness ? Bryan Stevenson What we do inthe memorial spaces says a lot about who we are.The American South is littered with the iconography of the Confederacy.We are celebrating the architects and defenders of slavery.I don t think we understand what that means for our commitment to equality and fairness and justice. If there were Hitler statutes all over Germany, I couldn t go there. I just couldn t.I would not able to make peace with the nation that was still comfortable with the era of German history where Nazis were responsible for the death of millions of Jewish people in concentration camps.But if you go to Berlin, the Holocaust memorial is extraordinary.You can barely go a hundred feet without seeing a monument that s been placed at the home of a Jewish family that was abducted. In Rwanda, you are required to hear about the genocide. You can t go to Rwanda and spend a few days without someone talking to you about the damage and despair and the hurt and the pain created by that horror. In the genocide museum there, there are actually human skulls; that s how powerfully people want to express their grief.In South Africa, you are required to see the consequences of apartheid.There are places where camps and prisons have been turned into visiting sites where people can reflect on that legacy. In this country, we don t talk about slavery. We don t talk about lynching.Worse, we ve created the counternarrative that says we have nothing about which we should be ashamed. Our past is romantic and glorious. In my state of Alabama, Jefferson Davis s birthday is a state holiday.Confederate Memorial Day is a state holiday.We don t even have Martin Luther King Day in Alabama. We have Martin Luther King/Robert E. Lee Day. Our two largest high schools are Robert E.Lee High and Jefferson Davis High.They re both 90-some percent African-American. If we don t think it matters, then I think we re just kidding ourselves. We do think it matters; that s why we have a 9 / 11 memorial.What we haven t done is understand what we are saying about who we are. I think we have to increase our shame— and I don t think shame is a bad thing. I worked with people in jails and prisons, and most parole boards will make my clients say, I am sorry,' before they can get parole. It s a requirement in many states that you have to show remorse, even if you have a perfect prison record, before they will let you out. We require that because our sense of comfort, our sense of safety, is compromised if we don t think you appreciate the wrongfulness of your criminal act. In faith perspectives, to get to salvation — at least in the Christian tradition — you have to repent. There is no redemption without acknowledgement of sin. It s not bad to repent. It s cleansing.It s necessary. It s ultimately liberating to acknowledge where we were and where we want to go.We haven t done that collectively. Ezra Klein I have several million follow - up questions to ask you here.I want to put a pin in shame because I want us to talk about shame in a couple of minutes.But I want to spend another moment on the built environment. When I began preparing for this interview and hearing you talk about the way the South looks to you, I thought a lot about a trip I took to Germany a number of years ago.I was there to observe the political convention of the Social Democratic Party.In Germany, you cannot get a more anti - Hitler party than the Social Democrats.They were jailed for their anti - Nazi position.But I remember being there and being at the convention and realizing something was physiologically very wrong in me.I was very upset.I was very anxious.My heart was racing.It took me a minute to figure out what was going on.What was happening was that I was walking through halls hearing German on loudspeakers.For me, being Jewish, that had a very powerful physical effect on me. What does it feel like to be an African - American man going to Robert E.Lee High School or walking by a Jefferson Davis statue ? What is the lived experience of that ? I think people can conceptualize why maybe it is abstractly unjust, but what role does it have in your daily life ? Bryan Stevenson I grew up in the segregated South.My mom was one of these people who could answer any question in the world you asked her even though she didn t go to college, and no one in my family had gone to college. She really valued education. The only time I could remember my mom not asking answering my question is when we would drive pass the public school and I would ask my mom what the word public meant. She didn t want me to understand that it meant I should be able to go to that school but instead we re going to this little shack called the colored school.There is an accumulated burden when you have to keep dealing with these things, when you are excluded and disfavored, when you are presumed dangerous and guilty. I grew up in the 60 s and the polio vaccine was being disseminated widely.They wanted to eradicate polio, and they wanted all the children to get polio shots.I remember we didn t have a doctor in our county. They made everybody go to a building where they were supposed to get shots. Of course, the white kids went to the front door and got their shot first, and the black kids had to wait outside the back door.Finally, when they got to the black kids, the nurses who were administering these shots were tired because it had just taken a long time and they d run out of lollipops to give the kids to help temper the sting of that needle. By the time they got to the black kids, they were just rough. My sister was in front of me, and they grabbed my sister by the arm and they picked up the needle and they jabbed it into her arm, and she started screaming. My mother was this amazing kind, loving person.She was a minister of music.She was so gentle.When they grabbed me by the arm, I started screaming for my mother.The nurse was about to put this needle in my arm.Then all of a sudden, I heard all of this glass breaking.My mother had gotten so angry and frustrated.She walked over to a wall.She picked up a tray of beakers and started throwing them against the wall.She was screaming, It s not right. It s not fair. You made us wait out there; it s not right. The doctor came in and said, Call the police. I remember the black ministers coming forward and begging the doctor not to call the police.One of them actually fell to his knees and said, Please don t call the police. We re sorry. We ll go and get her out of here. It was this performance at trying to preserve the medical care that these black children needed in the face of a protest about how unjustly and unfairly this process was working.When you have to act like that, when you have to live like that, when you have to do that over and over and over again, it weighs on you.It injures you. Ezra Klein It seems to me that our politics at the moment, and the rise of this president in particular, is built on a rejection of the idea that we should feel shame.It s built on a desire to not feel that shame — to in fact say that what has been given back is now more than enough, that the class that should be considered aggrieved, that should be considered disrespected, that should be considered in need of sympathy and empathy and understanding has actually changed to rural whites. The project you re undertaking here feels to me— and I don t mean this in the way I think the term is often used— un - American.Un - American in the sense that America has been a society that is particularly resistant to shame, that believes in the value and forgetting things quickly and moving on from things fast.Do you see the project of trying to rehabilitate shame and its role in American life as something that is counter to our history and culture ? Bryan Stevenson I agree that we don t have a political culture that rewards those who recognize they ve made a mistake.We have a political culture where most of our politicians think that if they stand up and say, I made a mistake, and I m sorry, that makes them look weak. In our personal lives, in our familial lives, we understand the importance of remorse and regret.You show me two people who ve been in love for 50 years, I ll show you two people who ve learn how to apologize to one another when they hurt each other, when they fall down. That s a stronger union.As I mentioned, in the criminal justice context, we insist on it.We insist on offenders expressing their shame before we trust them again. I don t have an interest in humiliating people. In fact, one of the reasons why I think we struggle so much with confronting our failures is that we ve created such a punitive society.We re so punitive in America that I think most people think if they say, I m wrong, 'or, I made a mistake, 'that they re going to punished for that. I don t want to punish this country for these decades of abuses.I want to liberate us. I actually believe in redemption.I believe in recovery.I believe in rehabilitation.That s why I advocate for people on death row and children who committed violent crimes and people who have broken the law. I believe in it for our country too. We cannot get to the reconciliation without the truth. We cannot get there if we don t acknowledge what it is we are struggling to recover from. Ezra Klein You made a point earlier in our conversation that I thought was very profound, where you said that because of our history, it doesn t take much for us to create distrust in this country. There are a lot of people we re talking about whom members of their race took a lot, but it s not like they re doing so well now. There s nothing they feel they have to give.They live in communities rocked by opioids, that have too few jobs, that are in intense distress themselves.Some of these folks might look at that stronger union you talk about and say, That is union in which I am not stronger.' Bryan Stevenson Yeah, I understand the appeal of that analysis.Only one in four Southerners owned enslaved people.The masses benefited from slavery, but they weren t the property owners. They weren t the slave owners.And yet they were the men and women who died on those battlefields. They paid the cost. That s been true throughout the 20th century. We had a massive movement in this country to build workers rights and to empower people and to create forces that could better protect workers. That was ultimately undermined, and it continues to be undermined by these politics of fear and anger, where we distract people with the race problem here or the immigration problem there. That s not to say that there aren t real problems.What I m saying is that, actually, if you don t give in to that, something better waits for you. My state of Alabama resisted integration as much as anybody in America.",

We talk about that, as well as why it s been so hard for technology to cut costs in health care, the Singaporean health care system and the lessons American can learn from it, the way regulation protects incumbents, the government s strangely structured investments in electronic medical records, and whether Silicon Valley s move-fast-and-break-things culture can work for something as personal as medical care. We also discuss Gurley s view that democracy and capitalism will, if given enough time, eat each other, and why he s looking to China for the next great health innovations.

In her book, she says she had at least one big disagreement with President Obama — a disagreement that speaks to the direction she wants to lead the party. So we began there. (This interview has been edited for length and clarity. You can download or stream the full discussion on my podcast.) Ezra Klein In your new book, you talk about a speech President Obama gave in the summer of 2016 where he said, The system isn t as rigged as you think. You write that, No, President Obama, the system is as rigged as we think. In fact, it s worse than most Americans realize. What do people miss about the rigging? Money slithers through Washington like a snake, and it s quiet, but the influence is everywhere. There are the obvious ways that we know about, the campaign contributions and armies of lobbyists. But it s so much more. It s bought-and-paid-for experts who testify before Congress and are quoted in the press. It s think tanks that are funded by shadowy money and always have a particular point of view that just seems to help the rich and the powerful get richer and more powerful. In the book, I talk about the revolving door and how people work on Wall Street for 20 years, and then take a spin through the revolving door and work in the Treasury Department, and then spin right back to Wall Street. The giant payouts that they give to people to go work in government are just stunning. I mean, millions of dollars. These big corporations! If you go teach, we got nothing for you.If you want to go build houses for Habitat for Humanity, we ll give you a firm handshake. If you ll go work in government, we ll write you this giant check to go do that. What is that, except by way of saying, Remember us, because you re going to be the one driving the bus, and when you re driving the bus, keep in mind all the things we care about. Money pervades. It s whose phone calls do you take.It s who you see in the evenings. It s who are your old friends.It s every part of it, so that the rich and the powerful are incredibly well-represented, not just at the top in the White House but all the way through government in this town. Ezra Klein Let me ask you about the other side of this. One thing that can happen, particularly on the left, is that disagreement gets dismissed as the system being rigged. I think sometimes about a quote Bernie Sanders had where he said that only 10 to 15 percent of the population would be Republican if not for big money obfuscating everything and changing people s minds. Do you think that s right ? Or is that an easy out, where liberals who want to see something controversial get done find it easier to say, That s not happening because the rich are stopping it,   rather than, That s not happening because Republicans really disagree, or because the public doesn t trust the government to take on that kind of a role, or because people just fear change ? Look, I get the point.There are just things on which we disagree.You notice Bernie s quote did not say nobody could be a Republican. He just says, Look, a lot of the reason that Republicans are able to get out there and get votes is because the influence of money has changed the landscape, has tilted the playing field, has changed how people think about these issues and how people debate these issues. We need to have the real debates, we should have the real debates, but sometimes it s frustrating because when you try to have them, it s against an onslaught that is so profoundly funded by money. I mean, what did you think when you saw billionaires jump in a little over a year ago when Justice Scalia died ? President Obama comes up with the all - American consensus candidate, Merrick Garland, someone who had won praise from not just the left but the right, and the hammer drops, bam!Mitch McConnell announces, We re not even going to meet with him, we re not going to have any hearings, and money starts rolling in . You know, if money hadn t rolled in to start running those ads against Merrick Garland, to threaten to run ads against Republicans who didn t fall into line, then my guess is a lot of folks across America, Democrats and Republicans, would have said, You know, he looks like a pretty good choice. He doesn t excite anybody on either end of the spectrum, [but he s] the sort of guy who ought to be able to get 60 votes. Let s give him a hearing, let s see what he s like. And he would be sitting on the United States Supreme Court.Instead, money made itself felt in that process, and what we ended up with is a justice who, again, money was spent to advance[Neil] Gorsuch. Let s say we got incredibly powerful campaign finance and just money-in-politics reform through Congress. Let s say the only money that any person or corporation could spend on any political activity whatsoever is $250.Now politics is running off small - donor donations.Merrick Garland, as much as he was a very centrist candidate, would have taken a Court that was 5 - 4 Republican to 5 - 4 Democratic.I think that in that world, if you are a religious conservative and you re somebody who s sending in those $250 donations, you would have still seen that as a big problem. To me, this is where we get this question of how do you unrig the system.In some ways, I think both President Obama and President Trump ran for the office on a little bit of a similar argument, which is that, I will come in and I will be above this. Obama in a sort of idealistic way, Trump because he s already so rich that he doesn t care what the special interests think, but both of them came in and said, I can pull the system out of this space, and that wasn t true. So how do you unrig it? Can a president unrig it? For me, the world shifted not just when Donald Trump was elected but when the Women s March happened the next day.Millions of people across this country got connected and started showing up during the health care debates, and started showing up in airports when the immigration ban was signed.To me, that s a moment American history changed. No longer was it politics is every four years for most Americans. No, it was a moment when people said, I m going to use everything I ve got to make sure that this government reflects my values, and I think that s the moment it shifted. Here s the part right now that I think is so exciting, Ezra, and why I m actually very optimistic at this moment.Fighting back the assault on health care that the Republicans launched through Trumpcare, when we beat that back, we proved that just showing up, just getting in the fight, just being willing to talk about it could change an outcome. I get it that the reason officially that the bill didn t go through was because for a handful of Republicans it was not brutal enough. You know, it hadn t hurt people enough or produced a big enough tax cut.But here s what s interesting.The rest of those Republicans, they didn t fall over that cliff, and why not? Because all the people who had shown up, who had made phone calls, who had sent emails, who had done Facebook posts ... that s democracy. Let me push you on this a bit, because I think this is one of the great questions of politics.Obamacare is such a good example.When it was passing and then after it passed, it powered the Tea Party movement.Barack Obama was never able to get the crowds out for Obamacare that he could get out for himself during the campaign.Then when Obamacare was about to get taken away, loss aversion kicked in again on the liberal side.All of a sudden, the repealers could not get anybody out anywhere, but liberals were able to get big crowds out to town halls all over the country. This bears on unrigging the system.People put a lot of their energy into electing the president.Then when their person is in there, they say, You should be able to do this now. We got you elected. The other side, which feels powerless, says, We re going to come into the streets and stop it. How do you merge the getting - somebody - elected with staying in the streets ? It s a great question, but I read this time period slightly differently. I think that once he got elected, President Obama thought the goodness of the thing he was passing spoke for itself. I don t think he really was out there beating the bushes trying to get the crowds, trying to get people to help him push this thing forward.I don t think we ve tested whether you can use the energy of democracy to get something passed. I want to give you something else .Remember, the crash happens in 2008, and we know we re going to do financial reform. The original focus was on Wall Street, but I had this idea for this consumer agency. The basic idea behind it was to say, We ve got to take all these various consumer laws, put them with one agency, and hold that agency responsible for enforcing them. The problem was we had plenty of laws, but they were all scattered, and they just weren t a first priority for anybody. How do you get an agency through like that? An agency that basically takes aim at the profit centers of some of the largest financial institutions in this country and says, You can t do what you re doing.  We put the proposal out there.The big banks said, No, never, will not happen. They spend more than a million dollars a day— that s every day, including Saturdays and Sundays — to lobby against the financial reforms generally, but let s face it, the center of the bull s - eye on what they were lobbying against was that consumer agency. How did we turn it into law ? We turned it into law through democracy.We got enough people around this country engaged, writing letters, making phone calls, doing Facebook posts.Here s the best part. It s a good strong agency.It s been out there, what, about five years now? It has already forced the biggest financial institutions in this country to return more than $12 billion directly to people they ve cheated.It has already handled more than a million complaints to people.I ll say to everybody, go to CFPB.gov if you ve been cheated out of $15 or $15, 000. They may be able to help you on this. It s the people s agency.It works, and banks have been after it and after it and after it, but by golly, it s got enough support that, so far at least, they haven t been able to take the legs out from underneath it. You have a very interesting couple of chapters in the book about the way you approached fighting Trump.You talked about the tweets you sent and the way you attacked him, and you sort of say, Look, I ve had to go hard against Trump, and I didn t like it and I know it makes people uncomfortable, but it s how you get people to pay attention. That speaks to something I ve been thinking about a lot, which is: Is the only way to fight the angry form of faux-populism Trump represents with an also-angry form of populism? How does everything not become Trumpified in the age of Trump? How is there space for a politics that is not the one he has set up? I think that s a really terrific question.I think the most important thing we can do is be in the fight.I actually do think the fight metaphor is right, that this is how democracy works now, that everything we hold dear is truly under assault.But the second part, we can t shoot at everything that moves. Trump is about to end his first 100 days. Either it worked or it didn t work.People have been persuaded or they haven t been persuaded. We ve got to be focused on what Donald Trump is actually doing.Ultimately, Donald Trump will be held accountable for what he does. What Trump I think understood is that the public sees both corporations and the government as in some ways merged.It s a class of the powerful. What is your program for raising the public s trust in government ? Well, the first part is you ve actually got to get out there and fight on the people s side.I mean, this is not a world where you just get to say, Hey, we love you, we re here from the government. You ve actually got to deliver. The second part is when you do deliver, you actually need to talk about it. Get out there and talk with people about why this is what we re trying, and listen to feedback.If it s not working for the people it was supposed to be working for, then change it. You know, I have three brothers who are veterans, and my brothers have given me an earful about the Veterans Administration. I know the scandal s the big part, but the way I look at this is the guy at the top, I have no doubt, really wants to try to deliver for veterans, but could he get out there and listen to some veterans and what it feels like to them on the ground ? I think a big part of this is we ve got to engage people more with their government. We ve got to be willing to listen, and we ve got to be willing to make change, and you know what that means? We ve also got to be willing to take some chances, to try some things that haven t been tried before. Something I ve always been interested in in your vision is you ve always been focused, I think somewhat unusually among politicians, on the way complexity in policy and process creates space for power to take things over. I m curious about how you think of that on a systemic level. The public cannot be focused on every single hearing, on every single regulation, coming down the pike.So how do you protect those processes from takeover by the moneyed interests who do have the power and the interest and the incentive and the cash to spend time on it, and to send really well - prepared lobbyists ? How do you make your concern with complexity into a vision for how to run the government ? This was a huge issue for me when I was thinking about setting up the consumer agency.I had a year, basically, to come in and try to put it together.What I kept thinking about is how the more complex our rules are, the more opportunities there will be for, over time, the most powerful actors— the biggest banks, the biggest debt collectors— to come in and get just a little shading for themselves. Over time, an agency will hear only from the giant corporations whose ox is being gored.They won t hear from the people that every single day are ultimately affected by the decisions they make. You are right when you say the problem is not bad faith of regulators. It s the structural problem that complexity requires real resources to navigate, and that s why it is that it favors the richest and most powerful. For me, what that meant, for example over at the consumer agency, was two parts that I can tell you about right from the beginning. One was how to get the consumer s voice back into the process.Not just once.Not just you came to it as a regulator with a good heart because you d worked somewhere else where you d had a chance to see it.It was how you got it in every day, and that s where I think that the complaint line is actually one of the most amazing things about the consumer agency. If you ever get a chance, go over and actually visit them, and they ll show you how the thing works. I know people who worked on that line, not at the top, but at the bottom.One thing that s amazing to me is the culture there took that line so seriously. That s what doesn t happen in other agencies. That was the thing! When I was setting up the complaint line, I looked around at the other agencies, because in fact there are a bunch of complaint lines of some form or another where you can send complaints in on the federal government. I was just appalled. I mean, they were just thrown into cardboard boxes. They were given to the employee who does the least and is in the furthest corner in the dingiest office, which is kind of a signal in itself. I did everything I could when I was setting up that agency to give that complaint hotline good space, to make sure really smart, terrific people [were] running it, and then [to] integrate it through the agency. They started making heat maps out of the complaints, so you can actually run the data and say, Wow, we re starting to get a lot of complaints on student loans.Student loans, huh.Wait, now let s analyze that again. Oh, they re all coming about one particular lender, and you tell the enforcement division about this. You tell the outreach division. It keeps the focus on the people the agency is supposed to serve. That s the key. Then it s, what kind of rules do you write? Do you write rules that go on forever and ever and ever and ever and ever, or do you try to write rules that, yeah, they don t cover every contingency, but they re fairly clear, they re fairly bright-line? Rules that most ordinary English speakers could read and understand? I know you ve got to get to your next appointment, so here s a question we use to end the podcast. What are three books you d recommend to the audience? Evicted. Have you read it? By Matthew Desmond? Yes, fantastic. God, it is. It s a book that tells you about housing and why housing is one way to understand how the world works. $2 a Day [by Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer]. It gives another vision of how hard it is trying to make it from day to day to day when you re poor. My third, how about The Little Engine That Could?",

Which is all to say that I m a bit obsessed with Newport s work right now, and particularly his account of how the digital environment we inhabit is training us out of concentration and into distraction in ways that are bad for our minds, bad for our work, and ultimately bad for the world.So I invited him onto my podcast for a long, searching conversation about the role technology is playing in our lives. In conversation, Newport doesn t disappoint.For him, the idea of deep work isn t a mere productivity hack— it s a path toward a better life, and a way of retaking control from technologies that are built to addict us more than they re built to aid us: Ezra Klein There can be a way in which this conversation sounds like it is about making people into hyper - productive widget makers.One of the things I thought was interesting in the book was that your argument is that this is the way to work less, to have gotten enough done that at 5: 00 pm, or whenever it is you leave, you can actually go home and spend the time with your family. Cal Newport If you prioritize depth, focusing intensely on things that matter, being skeptical of the shallow things that don t, it doesn t make you into an automaton.Actually, it embraces, and I think, amplifies, what makes you human.Doing deep thinking, for example, is a deeply human activity.It s something that only humans can do. It s immensely satisfying. I m a long advocate of what I call fixed schedule productivity,' where I fix my work schedule first. That s the stake in the ground I start with.Everything else about my career decisions, how I work, what I take on, what I do inthe day, all works backward from I want to be done at 5: 30. I think my life is the opposite of hyper - scheduled. I end the book with this quote. A deep life is a good life. It s not just about making you more productive. A lot of the discussions that are just starting to emerge around technology in this time and its role, not just professionally, but in our lives, in our politics, are fascinating. I think people like Jaron Lanier and Douglas Rushkoff are writing books that are going to be seen as classics 25 years from now. But Newport isn t just a philosopher of technology.He s intensely practical about how to wrest your time and attention back from all the programs built to distract and obsess you. Ezra Klein Let s say you re listening to this, and you re persuaded, but you don t really know where to begin.What are the first three steps you would urge somebody to take ? Cal Newport In terms of trying to actively promote depth in your life, start putting on your calendar some appointments with yourself to do deep work.Go a couple weeks out and treat those appointments like you would a doctor s appointment or a meeting with an investor. If someone tries to schedule something during that time, you say, No, I m busy from one to three, but here s when I m available. People understand the semantics around the meetings and appointments.They re willing to work around it. You don t have to explain why.Start with a moderate amount, say three or four hours a week.Have it on the calendar.Have it protected.And during those prescheduled times, maintain the zero - tolerance distraction policy.During those times, not a glance at the internet, not a glance at the phone. The second thing is, take some step to start gaining back cognitive fitness.Most people are not willing, for example, to just blanket quit social media; but I would suggest a couple things.One, take social media applications off your phone. I ve had a lot of people who say, I can give you 19 reasons why I have to use social media, why it s so important in my life, and then they do this experiment where they take it off their phone so it becomes 10 percent more difficult to log in to Facebook or Twitter. They stop using it altogether. They realize, Okay, wait a second. Maybe I was telling all these stories about the key role it plays in my life, and why I always have to be looking at it, but once I added just a slight impediment, I stopped using it altogether. I think it helps sort of reassess the value, but more importantly, you take the addictive aspects out of the service while still maintaining your access to the information or other value that you get out of it. The third thing I would recommend is starting to schedule the time you do novel, distracting, stimulating things.You could schedule lots of times, but it should be scheduled times.Maybe after work, you say, From 8 to 10, I m going to break out the laptop and just go nuts, no holds barred. Social media, whatever. But until 8, none of it. Or, Okay, at work, I m going to check my email, check on all of this at this time, this time, this time, this time. All the other times in between, even if you feel like you want to do it, you don t. This is all about just practicing that muscle of I want stimuli, and I said no. Even if you ve scheduled 25 blocks during the day when you re going to look at stimuli, that still gives you 25 blocks between those times where you re going to feel like you want to check stimuli and you say no.Every time you do that, that s helping to break the Pavlovian connection. That s usually how I get people started.Get it on the calendar, start cleaning up your cognitive fitness. Most of the conversations on my podcast are how to think about things differently.This one is too, but it s more importantly about how to do things differently, and why you should do them differently. I can say, with no exaggeration, that talking to Newport has changed how I spend my time— and how I think about the flashing icons on my toolbar.You may not agree with what he says, but it s a perspective worth hearing. You can listen to my full conversation with Newport(not to mention my past conversations with Chris Hayes, Tyler Cowen, Ta - Nehisi Coates, Arlie Hochschild, and more) by subscribing to The Ezra Klein Show on iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts.Or you can stream it off Soundcloud.",

Books: Democracy for Realists,   by Chris Achen and Larry BartelsLocking up our own,   by James Forman Racecraft,   by Barbara Fields and Karen FieldsGhettoside,   by Jill Leovy Cable news is not a reservoir of deep thinking or serious discourse.The incentives on television, a visual medium, are toward partisan hackery and spectacle.Fox News pioneered this approach in the 1990 s, and, more recently, CNN has reduced politics to pure theater. MSNBC s Chris Hayes is an exception, however.He s one of the sharpest minds on TV, and his nightly show, All In, is consistently smart and probing. Hayes, the author of A Colony in a Nation, recently sat down with Vox s Ezra Klein for a wide - ranging conversation about damn near everything— the failure of elites, declining social trust, the crisis of authority in American life, the roots of the criminal justice system, the opioid epidemic, and how he escapes the doom loop' that is the Trump presidency. Below, I pulled some of the more interesting parts of Hayes s exchange with Klein.The topics are varied, but they re all intriguing in their own right, and provide a snapshot of how Hayes thinks about politics as such. To listen to the entire conversation with Hayes, subscribe to Klein s podcast, The Ezra Klein Show, on iTunes, Spotify, or wherever you get your fine audio programming, or stream it off SoundCloud. Why no one has any idea what the term elites' means In the book, I actually take some time with this.In fact, I even say that this term has been stretched past the point of meaning.Partly because it s been a term tossed around forever, particularly in right-wing populism, in both global right-wing populism and American right-wing populism. So the term gets overdeployed. The other problem is that it s such a relative term. Gary Cohn, who s in the administration and is a former Goldman banker, is unquestionably an elite, right ? You run Vox— you re an elite.I host a cable news show— I m an elite.But there s also a lot of differences and distinctions between Gary Cohn and us. Like, that dude rolls at a completely different level of power and influence. Is a tenured professor at Amherst College an elite as well ? The problem with defining this term is that when you re talking about someone who has power and advantage in a society, there s a necessary relativity to it.So you can kind of slice the cake where you want it. How issues of social justice have been understood by large parts of the populace as essentially elite manners If you watch a farce, and it s the person at the dinner party who doesn t know which fork to use, that s the person you root for. In our politics, a huge part of the population has understood what I think are genuine struggles for social justice and equality as essentially elite manners. Michelle Goldberg makes this great point about Trump supporters, and it was my experience as well.She s like, A lot of people told me about political correctness, and almost no one told me about NAFTA when I would go to rallies. It was the violations of the taboos that people liked, at least the hardcore supporters who came to the rallies, more than it was trade. The guardians of culture that cluster in these urban centers have a set of social values and set of social taboos that I think are informed by genuine commitments toward justice, but also have this sort of aspect of elite manners that are understood by huge parts of the society as elite manners. The power of humiliation as a motivating force in human affairs I got really obsessed about this idea.I think it s a really underappreciated and under-interrogated experience. Part of the reason I found my way to it was reading about the American founders, who felt humiliated by the crown. Like, we think about the revolution in these kind of airy philosophical terms — self-representation, democracy, no taxation without representation. But on the front lines, when there s a mob beating up a customs official, they re doing that because they feel humiliated by the crown. There was a long section of the book about the Arab Spring and Mohamed Bouazizi, who was the fruit vendor in Tunisia who lit himself on fire.The reason he lit himself on fire was there was a cop that would come every day and harass him about the fruit he was selling without a license.It was a woman cop, which I think was part of the humiliation.He went to the government office to complain about this cop, and they said, Get out of here. He went home and he lit himself on fire. That humiliation, it turned out, was felt across the entire region.It erupted in revolution from country to country to country because, like you said, that emotion is so dangerous because it cannot go anywhere by definition.Rage is explosive.Sadness sort of comes out of us in certain ways.Humiliation just has to be bottled up because the powerful don t let you actually express yourself ... and it can lead to this kind of backlash politics. How the impulse to punish in America produced our perverse criminal justice system One of the central arguments of the book, and the central things it wrestles with, is there s no special interest to pin this on when you talk about what we built in criminal justice. There s no bank lobby, right ? It s not the health insurance companies. We built this. There was democratic, popular traction with this set of policies. There are interest groups, police unions, prison guard unions, upstate towns that employ lots of people in prisons, private prison industries that make it hard to dismantle absolutely. It wasn t built by special interest groups. It was built through small-d democracy. People really did vote for this. Now, the way that got transmuted is a complicated story, and whose vote mattered and whose voice mattered is a really complicated story. But by and large, this is a phenomenon of democratic will. There was an amazing moment at an event I did last night.I was talking about the opioid epidemic and this idea that there s more empathy in the rhetoric toward addicts in the sort of large swaths of white America, but that I wasn t yet convinced that was going to transfer into a more empathetic policy, because the sort of impulse toward wrath is so strong.People listened to that.Then someone got up and she said that the drug companies that ship those pain pills to this town in West Virginia, 9 million pills into this town of 400, they should all be in jail. That s the impulse. The impulse is to punish. It s not like a crazy impulse or wrong or even unjust in the circumstance.I do think the drug companies in this instance committed probably criminal felonies, but we want to see people punished.It s particular to America, in some ways, but it s also just broadly true. Why democratic politics is essentially tribal politics I ve thought about the way we would cover Iraqi politics in the nascent Iraqi state, post - Saddam.Basically, the way we would cover them from abroad was we would say, There s a Kurdish party. There s a Sunni party. There s a Shia party. They re vying for supremacy. Now, if you were in Iraq, there were all sorts of policy debates about the proper role of government and how large it should be.But we re just like, no, there s a fixed pie that these three groups are warring over, and their political parties are just the means by which they re doing that. If you covered American politics with enough perspective, it would look a lot like that; it would look like this battle between warring identity groups with tribal affiliations.The great discovery of Donald Trump was to simply lean into that.I do think it is the case that a lot of democracy is like that. On Trump s view that life is defined by zero - sum transactions The only belief I feel like he has, which forms the deepest core of his worldview, is this incredible belief in zero sumness in every domain at all times.Every single interaction is a pie that s going to be cut between him and someone else. He s going to win or lose.He s going to fuck them or they re going to fuck him. Like, it is unbelievable how he applies that to everything and how appealing it is to think in those terms. Avoiding the doom loop' even though the world is on fire and nothing is true anymore I tend to think of it in terms of my own behavior.Like, what am I going to do ?How am I going to avoid the doom loop ? My whole approach to the Trump era is to act as if reality matters, facts matter, the basic political gravity of whether you make people s lives better or worse matters, rigorous thinking, nonconspiratorial thinking, logical skepticism — all of these things, these principles I hold as a journalist, as a thinker, as a writer, as a citizen, they all matter. Act as if that s the case, even with the knowledge they may not. I don t know if in the end they will matter, but I can t figure out how to conduct myself in my life or in my work if they don t. I don t have an alternative to that.I don t know how to live in some sort of Hobbesian world of a war of all against all in which there are no rules and nothing matters and you can say whatever you want, whether it s true or not, and be this sort of vengeful and petty person.I don t know how to conduct myself in that world. The world I know how to conduct myself in is the world in which the values I believe in and hold and try to live by and work by win out in the end. On whether or not the media has been unfair to Trump I think there has been some sloppiness in response to Trump s sloppiness.I think part of that has to do with the fact that because almost any story you hear about Trump is facially plausible, there s an impulse to run with things before you can confirm them. You could tell me anything he said or did right now, and I would think to myself, Yeah, that totally could have happened.' This wasn t the case with Obama. How the Trump administration encourages and benefits from media sloppiness I think they luxuriate in our sloppiness.They are constantly laying land mines to blow up the press so that the press gets it wrong, so they could call them on it, as opposed to attempting to get their message out as accurately as possible, which is bizarre.It s the inverse of what White Houses usually do. Usually White Houses will try to work with you to be like, I just want to call you ahead of time. We re putting up this executive order.Here are the things it does and doesn t do. But Trump just throws the executive order at you, waits for you to go on air and get it wrong, then says you got it wrong and calls it fake news.' Part of what he has done, which is both brilliant and loathsome, is turn the press into an adversary, a mirror of the polarized existence we live in , which is a way of discrediting them to half the country, which is obviously a very old trick, but he has taken it to this incredible performative extreme.Sometimes it feels like you are being cast as the heel to his face, or the face to his heel, in a wrestling match that you re performing even as you re trying to do your job. The center - of -right ideas the left ought to engage The entirety of the corpus of Hayek, Friedman, and neoclassical economics.I think it s an incredibly powerful intellectual tradition and a really important one to understand, these basic frameworks of neoclassical economics, the sort of ideas about market clearing prices, about the functioning of supply and demand, about thinking in marginal terms. I think the tradition of economic thinking has been really influential.I think it s actually a thing that people on the left really should do — take the time to understand all of that. There is a tremendous amount of incredible insight into some of the things we re talking about, like non - zero - sum settings, and the way in which human exchange can be generative in this sort of amazing way.Understanding how capitalism works has been really, really important for me, and has been something that I feel like I m a better thinker and an analyst because of the time and reading I put into a lot of conservative authors on that topic.",

I took a lot away from it, and I think you will too. Books:-Autobiography of John Stuart Mills-Derek Parfitt s Reasons and Persons-Fisher Black s On Business Cycles I have never come across a mind quite like Tyler Cowen s.The George Mason University economist, and Marginal Revolution blogger, has an interesting opinion on, well, everything. So for my podcast conversation with him— which you can listen to on iTunes, SoundCloud, or wherever you get your podcasts— I had a simple plan: ask Cowen for his thoughts on as many topics as possible.And I think it worked out pretty well.We discuss everything from New Jersey to high school sports to finding love to smoked trout to nootropics to Thomas Schelling to Ayn Rand to social media to speed reading strategies to happy relationships to Donald Trump to the disadvantages of growing up in Manhattan.And believe me when I say that is a small sampling of what we covered. We also talk about Tyler s new book, The Complacent Class, which argues, in true Cowenian fashion, that everything we think we know about the present is wrong, and that far from being an age of rapid change and constant risk, we have become a cautious, even stagnant, society. At the end of our discussion, I did a lightning round with Cowen, where I asked him for his snap reactions on everything from a universal basic income to superhero films to geoengineering to a cashless society.A transcript of that section, edited for length and clarity, follows here.For the full conversation, subscribe to my podcast! Ezra Klein So I m going to move now to asking you about a couple of ideas that are out there right now that I would like your views on.Let s start with the idea, pushed by Elon Musk and others, that we live in a computer simulation. Tyler Cowen I understand the Bayesian logic that it ought to be true, but I don t think it is.Here s the way I would put it: In most plausible theories of the universe, the universe is a kind of computation.So to the extent it s true, it s probably trivial.Everything s computation. Ezra Klein Universal basic income. Tyler Cowen I used to favor it; now I m pretty skeptical.The more you think that politics is about symbolic values, the more I feel we need to put up a big sign on this country that says, We re for immigrants who really want to work and create.' I ve become a fan of doing a lot of your welfare through jobs.I get that it s economically inefficient, and I get that it doesn t cover everyone, but I feel the ultimate long - run returns to that are pretty high and I ve become a fan of it. Ezra Klein You mean you ve become a fan of something more like a basic jobs guarantee or giant public works programs ? Tyler Cowen Well, those would depend on the cyclical state of the economy, but the earned income tax credit, where you pay people extra for working.I ve moved closer to the position of wanting coverage to not be so universal, and to attract the better mix of immigrants, and have a really strong pro - work ethic in society, understanding people will go uncovered.I don t want that for New Zealand, but if your country is the global generator of innovation and public goods, I think you should take that very seriously. Ezra Klein Then, related to that: the idea that artificial intelligence and automation will lead to, let s say, a doubling of unemployment in 15 years. Tyler Cowen That s extremely unlikely.I think it will lower labor force participation for working - age males, as it has already, and that s a big problem.But the extreme scenarios are far overblown. Ezra Klein But if you believe that we re already seeing working - age males displaced by automation, then doesn t that cut against having a social support system even more tied to work ? Tyler Cowen My fear is that if you take those working - age males and allow them to continue not to work, you ll ultimately make the problem worse.There s some shift in norms needed: some mix of some of those males learning to do subservient service sector jobs; some shift of those males learning to migrate more, sometimes even to other countries; and some shift of becoming more stoic and more content.I think we re seeing, partly from the Trump campaign, people want jobs.Yes, they want support, but what makes them happy is jobs. Ezra Klein Are there ways the government could provide jobs ? And I mean just jobs.I don t mean the way they could help boost the economy.I think everybody believes they should do that.But to the extent that policymakers believe they have maxed out on what they can do to help the economy, to what degree should the government just be providing make - work ? Tyler Cowen I consider that option more seriously.I don t know the answer.I do, of course, think we should build more infrastructure.So you build the smart grid— how many of the problem people will that put to work ? I don t know, but I seriously worry the answer is not enough. If there were a Straussian way to have make - work jobs but cloaked as something else, and if that were sustainable, I would consider it.I m not sure that s possible.But I think we need to experiment in that space more. Ezra Klein Trump s vision of coercive capitalism, where he goes and says, You, you re a good company, you kept jobs here; you, you re a bad company, you sent jobs away.' Tyler Cowen Well, it s terrible, but if that s the worst thing we get from him, I ll be extremely relieved. Ezra Klein Why is it terrible ? Tyler Cowen It politicizes all decisions.It means business leaders have an incentive to support him, and not oppose him, which might allow him to do other terrible things.In effect, it takes away free speech within the business community.And it s arbitrary and unfair. Ezra Klein The war on drugs. Tyler Cowen The war on drugs is a terrible thing.Other than selling drugs to children, I don t think people should ever go to jail for things they do to their own bodies.I would decriminalize all the drugs I know about.I m not sure you can completely legalize everything, but it shouldn t be a reason to send people to jail.Again, children excluded— that s a somewhat separate issue. Ezra Klein NATO. Tyler Cowen I love NATO; I hope we can keep it.Here s the positive scenario: Trump has said NATO is dead, and now the whole world is scurrying to defend and strengthen NATO.And if Trump does a flip on NATO, which I don t by any means rule out, this could actually be the thing that strengthens NATO.That s my hope; it s not my prediction.More likely than not, Trump is just increasing noise and uncertainty, and a lot of different alliances will fall away just because the US has become so unpredictable. Ezra Klein You say you love NATO.What do you think the role of NATO is in this era ? Tyler Cowen It s very simple: to stop Russian expansion in the East.Russia is in some regards a country with evil leadership.I think the standard Mitt Romney line that there are evil leaders and cultures and you need to watch out for them and take vigorous action is correct.Russia qualifies there, but you need cooperation.We don t have that right now. Ezra Klein Do you think we have culturally begun to underweight the dangers posed by other states ? Tyler Cowen Oh, absolutely.Again, if you re looking for a positive scenario from the Trump presidency, it may be a big wake - up call where we cease being so complacent.But the notion that China is a major expansionist power— though not aggressive toward America at all— that Russia is potentially a major expansionist power in Eurasia, those are the two most important facts about the world right now, and they re not really on the minds of the American people. Ezra Klein Fake news. Tyler Cowen We ve had fake news for a long time.The satanic kidnappings, or we re not really bombing Laos and Cambodia.'Fake news is terrible, but I think recently it s gotten too much play. The problem is relative frequencies of real news much more than fake news. Ezra Klein Is social media good for people ? Tyler Cowen We don t know yet.As I said before, it s this huge experiment being done without controls.I suspect it s good for weirdos but maybe not that great for society as a whole.But a lot of us are weirdos, so it may be a net positive. Ezra Klein American exceptionalism. Tyler Cowen I do believe America is an exceptional nation and should think of itself as such.And this norm weakening is one of my great worries about this current time.If you ask what makes America exceptional, it s the embedded mix of religiosity and the high status we re willing to give to businessmen.Our belief that our way of life is best, which of course it isn t, but we believe it, and that s overall a good thing.And this Puritan notion that there are individual life projects and it s your highest calling to pursue them.And we both live by this, even though neither of us is Protestant.And I think that combination is just fantastic, though dangerous too. Ezra Klein Making society cashless. Tyler Cowen My first book was about a cashless society.And I predicted this will happen, and I think it will happen.But I worry more on the normative side about privacy issues than I did in the past.The book came out in the early 90 s.I didn t think surveillance would be such a big deal. It could be we re already going to lose our privacy anyway, with or without cash. So I think it will make macro policy in some ways better. But I worry about the bigger trend it s embedded in, and that s lack of privacy and way too much surveillance. Ezra Klein Transhumanism, biohacking. Tyler Cowen I m more skeptical about CRISPR and genetic engineering than almost all the other smart people I know.I feel we ll mess it up.I feel tyrants may pursue it more vigorously than free societies.I feel even if it works, it may make the human race too conformist.Parents want a certain amount of conformity in their children, and they want all of their children to do well enough.And we may end up with too few weirdos.So I m mostly skeptical. I do hope it works out; there s a good chance it will.But I d rather be a voice of caution at current margins. Ezra Klein Climate change. Tyler Cowen If by climate change you mean global warming caused by CO2 emissions, there s a growing chance it s a huge problem.I m not sure numerically how large that is, but we ought to do what we can against it.I favor a carbon tax, but I suspect that s not enough.And what to do beyond that, I m not sure I have the expertise to judge.But I d say it s the extra stuff we do that probably will make the difference, and it may just all boil down to luck. Ezra Klein Geoengineering. Tyler Cowen Well, we re geoengineering right now, right ? That s climate change.So I don t reject the notion the way some people do .Some people say, Oh, you talk about geoengineering, people will get complacent about climate change.'We re doing geoengineering.My great fear is the evil or semi - evil nations in the world will do it without cooperating.And it s a great danger.I don t know how to stop that. Ezra Klein The idea that Trump poses a fundamental threat to democratic institutions.That he could build some kind of autocracy, some kind of crony capitalist Putin - esque system.The idea that there is something here that is not just a presidency you disagree with but a presidency that could in some fundamental way alter the workings of our political system going forward. Tyler Cowen I do see the Trump administration as a fundamental threat, but I think the main threat is foreign policy.A mix of unpredictability of temperament and uncertainty of policy leading alliances to crumble.And also a higher chance of a war with another major power.That to me is all terrible. At least so far, I m a bit more in the Ross Douthat camp, that what Trump is doing are signs of weakness and the system will beat him, than I am in thinking he will end up being a fundamental threat.But look, certainly he s more of a fundamental threat to democracy than any of the other candidates, who all were at zero on that margin.Still, I m mostly at this point agreeing with Ross that he doesn t know what he s doing.The actual fascists were in fact quite politically skilled, and odds are the system will beat Trump. Ezra Klein Making human beings a multi - planet species. Tyler Cowen I would be very surprised if that ever happened.Planets are far.They re harsh.They re hostile.Why don t we make Nevada a place to settle, or ocean platforms.There s plenty of space in the world.Seems a lot easier than other planets.I don t see what they have to offer in economic terms. Ezra Klein But isn t the idea that if Earth got hit by a giant asteroid, or got ripped through by a terrible pandemic, or had a nuclear war, or[ if] global warming becomes much, much worse than we think, that you need and want to have some diversification of your risk ? Tyler Cowen I don t think, say, a Mars colony could ever be very large.I suppose they have cheap solar power.But if we destroy ourselves, they re going to as well.They re more likely to destroy themselves than we are.They don t have much in the way of resources. If people want to try, I m not opposed.But I m very skeptical. Ezra Klein Effective altruism. Tyler Cowen Well, it s underrated by almost everyone, [because most] people just give money away indiscriminately.But I think people within the effective altruism movement way overrate it.They think they can rationally figure out where s the best place to give money, and they re very convinced a lot of establishment donations are not so worthwhile.I m not sure that s true. The idea of giving $1 million to Harvard if you re an alumnus, I m not sure that s the wrong thing to do .Harvard s this amazing self - sustaining, self - generating cluster.They earn a high rate of return .Even if Harvard s just a hedge fund, if they can earn 8 percent a year— which by the way, they haven t been doing lately— that s highly productive. I also think they don t take seriously enough the notion that if you make giving too rational, a lot of people will just do less of it. Ezra Klein Superhero movies. Tyler Cowen Most of them I don t like.Spider - Man II I loved.A few of the Supermans I thought were very good.The comic - book - based ones tend to be too tentpole for my tastes, and the powers people have are too arbitrary.I like superheroes like Flash or Superman, where the powers are well - defined and generalizable.But when they re sort of three weird things you can do and 11 you can t, 'then you have to keep track of it all and there s eight superhero mutants walking around the movie.I don t get it.There should be some kind of economy of means. Ezra Klein The idea that this is the golden age of television. Tyler Cowen I actually think television right now is not as good as movies, and it s a cool thing to have all your great, favorite TV shows.But the best movies are for some reason deeper and more moving, and they re very often from foreign countries.Not from Hollywood, which is at a weak point in its trajectory.But I would rather put my time into movies than television.I do have some shows I watch.But I think we should speak out against TV just a wee bit. Ezra Klein Burning Man. Tyler Cowen I ve never been, so I don t know.That s, I guess, a way in which I m not curious enough and I have too much status quo bias.I don t like the notion that you show up and you re cut off from your email.Is that how it is ? Ezra Klein Yeah. Tyler Cowen So that to me is trouble. Ezra Klein California seceding from the Union. Tyler Cowen I don t think it will ever happen.I don t think the United States in any feasible time scenario will ever split up.There s no clear line of demarcation.So Scotland leaving the United Kingdom, Catalonia leaving Spain, I wouldn t predict either, but it s clear what the line is, inside / outside.California doesn t quite have that.It is itself fairly divided.And once it becomes complicated how you split up the groups, as it is, say, in Iraq, that tends to weaken secessionist movements. Ezra Klein Brexit. Tyler Cowen I think Brexit will go down as a terrible event.But ultimately, I think it probably was necessary.And the EU was always built on overreach.And I m not sure it will be seen as a big deal.It will be seen, maybe, as a symptom. Ezra Klein Why is that ? Tyler Cowen If you think the European Union will get weaker anyway, and some other countries will leave anyway, no one s going to point their finger and say, Oh, those people behind Brexit, what wrong they did.'Nationalist intuitions don t go away.We re in an era where they re becoming stronger.And if you try to make everything multinational, it doesn t work.I think it s one thing we re learning.It s a shame.I would love to see free migration of Poles and Romanians into the United Kingdom.I don t think it s sustainable, though. Ezra Klein Life hacking, productivity hacking, the sort of Tim Ferriss 4 - Hour Workweek stuff. Tyler Cowen Well, four - hour workweek' is also known as unemployment.Those are mostly placebos, but placebos are beneficial.So you talk about them as an excuse or substitute for doing something.But at the same time, that s good for you, because if you re too anxious about not doing anything, you ll get more anxious yet and not do anything at all. Ezra Klein The rationality community. Tyler Cowen Well, tell me a little more what you mean.You mean Eliezer Yudkowsky ? Ezra Klein Yeah, I mean Less Wrong, Slate Star Codex.Julia Galef, Robin Hanson.Sometimes Bryan Caplan is grouped in here.The community of people who are frontloading ideas like signaling, cognitive biases, etc. Tyler Cowen Well, I enjoy all those sources, and I read them.That s obviously a kind of endorsement.But I would approve of them much more if they called themselves the irrationality community.Because it is just another kind of religion.A different set of ethoses.And there s nothing wrong with that, but the notion that this is, like, the true, objective vantage point I find highly objectionable.And that pops up in some of those people more than others.But I think it needs to be realized it s an extremely culturally specific way of viewing the world, and that s one of the main things travel can teach you. Ezra Klein Who do you always make a point to read ? Tyler Cowen You! Ezra Klein Oh, thank you. Tyler Cowen But I think overall I rely more on what is recommended to me a few times rather than the name of the person.So some of the people I would always read no matter what, like Derek Parfit or Fischer Black, they ve passed away.And we re moving to a world where the amount of good or great content is higher than ever before.But it s less person - tagged than ever before as well. Ezra Klein Where are you getting those recommendations ? Tyler Cowen Some of it is verbal.Some of it s my Twitter feed.Most of it s people email me things.I sometimes say my business model is reading my email.My philosophy is to answer every serious email I get.And if you do that, and get a lot of emails, over time people will email you wonderful things.",

Ball is one of my favorite people to talk politics with, and I hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I did. Molly Ball: politics reporter Molly Ball first recommended All the King s Men, a classic in American politics fiction that looks at the Depression-era South. Though a politics reporter, Ball also touted the Neapolitan Novels by Elena Ferrante. They are mind-blowingly good — and confirmed by doubts about human nature in a way that allowed me to understand this election better, Ball said.",

We discuss friendship, love, psychedelics, spirituality, death, health, and whether it s possible to get too addicted to productivity hacks(spoiler: it is).This is a discussion, in other words, about much of what makes life worth living, and it left me with a lot to think about. You can listen to our conversation by subscribing to my podcast, The Ezra Klein Show, on iTunes, Spotify, or wherever you get your fine audio programming.Or you can stream it off SoundCloud. Yuval Noah Harari s first book, Sapiens, was an international sensation.The Israeli historian s mind - bending tour through the trump of Homo sapiens is a favorite of , among others, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Barack Obama.His new book, Homo Deus: a Brief History of Tomorrow, is about what comes next for humanity— and the threat our own intelligence and creative capacity poses to our future.And it, too, is fantastically interesting. I ve wanted to talk to Harari since reading Sapiens.I ve had one big question about him: What kind of mind creates a book like Sapiens ? And now I know.A clear one. Virtually everything Harari says in our conversation is fascinating.But what I didn t expect was how central his consistent practice of Vipassana meditation— which includes a 60 - day silent retreat each year— is to understanding the works of both history and futurism he produces.In this excerpt from our discussion, which is edited for length and clarity, we dig deep into Harari s meditative practice and how it helps him see the stories humanity tells itself. To listen to my whole conversation with Harari— which delves into AI, the future of work, Harari s favorite books, and more— subscribe to my podcast, The Ezra Klein Show, on iTunes, Spotify, or wherever you get your fine audio programming, or stream it off SoundCloud. Ezra Klein You told the Guardian that without meditation, you d still be researching medieval military history — but not the Neanderthals or cyborgs. What changes has meditation brought to your work as a historian? Yuval Harari Two things, mainly.First of all, it s the ability to focus. When you train the mind to focus on something like the breath, it also gives you the discipline to focus on much bigger things and to really tell the difference between what s important and everything else .This is a discipline that I have brought to my scientific career as well.It s so difficult, especially when you deal with long-term history, to get bogged down in the small details or to be distracted by a million different tiny stories and concerns. It s so difficult to keep reminding yourself what is really the most important thing that has happened in history or what is the most important thing that is happening now in the world.The discipline to have this focus I really got from the meditation. The other major contribution, I think, is that the entire exercise of Vipassana meditation is to learn the difference between fiction and reality, what is real and what is just stories that we invent and construct in our own minds.Almost 99 percent you realize is just stories in our minds.This is also true of history.Most people, they just get overwhelmed by the religious stories, by the nationalist stories, by the economic stories of the day, and they take these stories to be the reality. My main ambition as a historian is to be able to tell the difference between what s really happening in the world and what are the fictions that humans have been creating for thousands of years in order to explain or in order to control what s happening in the world. Ezra Klein One of the ideas that is central to your book Sapiens is that the central quality of Homo sapiens, what has allowed us to dominate the earth, is the ability to tell stories and create fictions that permit widespread cooperation in a way other species can t. And what you count as fiction ranges all the way from early mythology to the Constitution of the United States of America. I wouldn t have connected that to the way meditation changes what you see as real, but it makes sense that if you re observing the way your mind creates imaginary stories, maybe much more ends up falling into that category than you originally thought. Yuval Harari Yes, exactly.We seldom realize it, but all large - scale human cooperation is based on fiction.This is most clear in the case ofreligion, especially other people s religion. You can easily understand that, yes, millions of people come together to cooperate in a crusade or a jihad or to build the cathedral or a synagogue because all of them believe some fictional story about God and heaven and hell. What is much more difficult to realize is that exactly the same dynamic operates in all other kinds of human cooperation.If you think about human rights, human rights are a fictional story just like God and heaven.They are not a biological reality.Biologically speaking, humans don t have rights. If you take Homo sapiens and look inside, you find the heart and the kidneys and the DNA. You don t find any rights.The only place rights exist is in the stories that people have been inventing. Another very good example is money.Money is probably the most successful story ever told.It has no objective value.It s not like a banana or a coconut. If you take a dollar bill and look at it, you can t eat it.You can t drink it. You can t wear it.It s absolutely worthless. We think it s worth something because we believe a story.We have these master storytellers of our society, our shamans— they are the bankers and the financiers and the chairperson of the Federal Reserve, and they come to us with this amazing story that, You see this green piece of paper? We tell you that it is worth one banana. If I believe it and you believe it and everybody believes it, it works.It actually works.I can take this worthless piece of paper, go to a complete stranger who I never met before, give him this piece of paper, and he in exchange will give me a real banana that I can eat. This is really amazing, and no other animal can do it.Other animals sometimes trade.Chimpanzees, for example, they trade.You give me a coconut.I ll give you a banana. That can work with a chimpanzee, but you give me a worthless piece of paper and you expect me to give you a banana? That will never work with a chimpanzee. This is why we control the world, and not the chimpanzees. Ezra Klein But there are ways in which those stories create fragility, too.You take something like the 2008 - 09 financial crisis.What happened there was the global financial markets had told themselves a story.They had told themselves a story about how much risk there was, in particular subprime mortgage debt, and that story turned out to be wrong.All of a sudden, they had to tell themselves a different story, and then all the stories built on that story collapsed— stories about how stocks in the lumber industry would do, and how many people would have jobs in a year.And eventually that changed reality. A fragility here is when you begin to mistake your stories for reality, and you overestimate both their permanence and how difficult it would be for them to be changed or moved. Yuval Harari Yes, it goes both ways.Because it is based on stories, human society is far more flexible and dynamic than any other society on earth, and at the same time, it s also far more fragile. Think, for example, about revolutions.Among other animals, it s very difficult to change the social system overnight. It s almost impossible.If you think about, for example, a beehive, the bees have had their social system for millions and millions of years, and they cannot change it unless through a very slow and very complicated process of natural selection and evolution.The bees cannot just wake up one morning, execute the queen bee, and establish a communist dictatorship of worker bees. But among humans, we do have such social revolutions.Exactly a century ago, 1917, you had the communist revolution in Russia, where the revolutionaries executed the czar and established a completely different social system in Russia within a few years just by changing the story Russians believed.They no longer believed in the divine right of the czar.Instead, they now believed that authority comes from the workers, from the people. This is why every society invests so much effort in propaganda and brainwashing people from a very early age to believe in the dominant story of the society, because if they don t believe, everything collapses. Ezra Klein Before we leave the topic of meditation, I read that you do routinely 60 - day retreats.That is an experience that I cannot imagine, so I would love to hear what those are like for you and what role they serve in your life. Yuval Harari First of all, it s very difficult. You don t have any distractions, you don t have television, you don t have emails, no phones, no books.You don t write. You just have every moment to focus on what is really happening right now, on what is reality. You come across the things you don t like about yourself, things that you don t like about the world, that you spend so much time ignoring or suppressing. You start with the most basic bodily sensations of the breath coming in and out, of sensations in your stomach, in your legs, and as you connect to that, you gain the ability to really observe what s happening. You get clarity with regard to what s happening in your mind.You cannot really observe anger or fear or boredom if you cannot observe your breath.Your breath is so much easier than observing your anger or your fear. People want to understand their anger, to understand their fear.But they think that observing the breath, oh, this is not important at all.But if you can t observe something as obvious and as simple as the breath coming in and out, you have absolutely no chance of really observing your anger, which is far more stormy and far more difficult. What happens along the 60 days is that as your mind becomes more focused and more clear, you go deeper and deeper, and you start seeing the sources of where all this anger is coming from, where all this fear is coming from, and you just observe.You don t try to do anything. You don t tell any stories about your anger.You don t try to fight it. Just observe. What is anger? What is boredom? You live sometimes for years and years and years experiencing anger and fear and boredom every day, and you never really observe, how does it actually feel to be angry? Because you re too caught up in the angry. The 60 days of meditation, they give you the opportunity.You can have a wave of anger, and sometimes it can last for days and you just, for days, you do nothing.You just observe.What is anger ? How does it actually feel in the body ? What is actually happening in my mind when I am angry ? This is the most amazing thing that I ve ever observed, is really to observe these internal phenomena. Ezra Klein It impresses me that you have the presence or the commitment to continue doing this.Sapiens was an international runaway best - seller.It s a huge hit in Silicon Valley. When I had Bill Gates on this podcast, he recommended Sapiens to me and to the audience. Mark Zuckerberg has talked about Sapiens. Barack Obama has talked about Sapiens. I imagine the demands of your time, the speaking engagements, the paid speaking engagements, the conferences and meetings that you get invited to now, I m sure there s vastly more than you can do. I m curious if your relationship to meditation has changed at all in the past couple of years after your success. Yuval Harari There is always temptation to take another speaking engagement or another conference, but I m very disciplined about it because I know this is the really important stuff. This is the source of my scientific success, so when I plan the year in advance, the first thing I do is — I already know that in 2017 I m going from the 15 th of October to the 15 th of December to India to sit at a 60 - day meditation retreat.That s the first thing I put in the schedule. Everything else has to be arranged around that. It was the same last year in 2016. Actually I heard about Trump s election only on the 20 th of January, because this is when I came out of the retreat.I entered in early November, and I missed the elections.As I said, you have absolutely no distractions.You have no connections with the outside world, no emails, no television, no nothing, so you don t know what s happening on the outside, but what s happening on the inside is so interesting. Ezra Klein Beyond the two hours of meditation you do daily, how do you structure the information you receive during the day ? How do you separate what is real and important and what is ephemera or mere stories ? Yuval Harari I try to set my own agenda and not to allow technology to set the agenda for me.I tend to read books, long books, rather than short passages or tweets.I think another thing that has happened over the last century is that we have moved from an information scarcity to a deluge of information.Previously the main problem with information for people was that they didn t have enough of it, and there was censorship, and information was very rare and hard to obtain. Now it s just the opposite.We are inundated by immense amounts of information. We really lose control of our attention.Our attention is hijacked by all kinds of external forces.For me, not just in meditation, but when I work, I try to be very, very disciplined with my attention not to allow external forces to take control of my attention. Ezra Klein It s surprising to me how much context this gives me for Homo Deus. To give a very capsule summary of the book, you re arguing that human beings used to have a society centered around stories about God.They moved to one in the last couple hundred years centered around stories about human beings.And now they re moving to one that is centered around stories about data. To the degree that we will be honored for our contributions to society, you say it will be for the contribution we make to the data streams that various computer - assisted algorithms are using to generate value and create production.I felt, reading the book, that that scenario looks more plausible to you than it does to me, but perhaps it is because you are stepping a little bit further out of the daily cacophony, and so the change and the degree to which everybody is obsessed and immersed in a lot of data all of the time is more clear. Yuval Harari Yeah, I think it s a very good summary of the new book. The way that I live influences the way I think, and hopefully the conclusions I reach in my research fit back into the way that I live — because just to reach a theoretical conclusion that has no influence on how you actually live, what s the point ?",

I spoke with Harari recently for my podcast, The Ezra Klein Show.To hear our whole conversation, subscribe on iTunes(or wherever you get your podcasts) or stream it off SoundCloud.In this excerpt, which has been edited for length and clarity, Harari and I discuss the rise of artificial intelligence, whether digital consciousness is a necessary byproduct of digital intelligence, and what it will all mean for human beings. RELATED Yuval Harari, author of Sapiens, on how meditation made him a better historian As you ll see, I m a bit less convinced than Harari is that the computers are coming for our jobs, and that human beings are on the edge of economic uselessness.But I could very well be wrong, and he makes a good case that I am. We also talk about virtual reality, and the possibility that we will manage the problem of economic irrelevance by retreating into artificial wonderlands that give us the meaning and the narrative that our daily lives deny us.Harari argues we ve been applying that salve for a millennium now— we just called it religion. Ezra Klein Do you think that in 200 or 300 years, human beings will be the dominant actor on Earth ? Yuval Harari Absolutely not.If you asked me in 50 years, it would be a difficult question, but 300 years, it s a very easy question. In 300 years, Homo sapiens will not be the dominate life form on Earth, if we exist at all. Given the current pace of technological development, it is possible we destroy ourselves in some ecological or nuclear calamity.The more likely possibility is that we will use bioengineering and machine learning and artificial intelligence either to upgrade ourselves into a totally different kind of being or to create a totally different kind of being that will take over. In any case, in 200 or 300 years, the beings that will dominate the Earth will be far more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals or from chimpanzees. Ezra Klein When I hear these kinds of arguments about AI s eventual triumph, it often seems to me to be the most cerebral humans— your Elon Musks and Yuval Hararis and Bill Gateses— overestimating the importance of cerebral capabilities.But it s not clear that it was our analytical capabilities that allowed us to dominate. It was our cooperation and other factors. Yuval Harari I totally agree that for success, cooperation is usually more important than just raw intelligence.But the thing is that AI will be far more cooperative, at least potentially, than humans.To take a famous example, everybody is now talking about self - driving cars.The huge advantage of a self - driving car over a human driver is not just that, as an individual vehicle, the self - driving car is likely to be safer, cheaper, and more efficient than a human - driven car.The really big advantage is that self - driving cars can all be connected to one another to form a single network in a way you cannot do with human drivers. It s the same with many other fields. If you think about medicine, today you have millions of human doctors and very often you have miscommunication between different doctors, but if you switch to AI doctors, you don t really have millions of different doctors.You have a single medical network that monitors the health of everybody in the world. If right now, as we speak, an AI doctor in Timbuktu discovers a new disease or a new treatment, this information is immediately available to my personal AI doctor on my smartphone.Some of the biggest advantages of AI are in the field of cooperation, not in intelligence. There is a lot of confusion about what artificial intelligence means or doesn t mean, especially in places like Silicon Valley. For me, the biggest confusion of all is between intelligence and consciousness. Ninety-five percent of science fiction movies are based on the error that an artificial intelligence will inevitably be an artificial consciousness. They assume that robots will have emotions, will feel things, that humans will fall in love with them, or that they will want to destroy us. This is not true. Intelligence is not consciousness.Intelligence is the ability to solve problems.Consciousness is the ability to feel things.In humans and other animals, the two indeed go together.The way mammals solve problems is by feeling things.Our emotions and sensations are really an integral part of the way we solve problems in our lives.However, in the case ofcomputers, we don t see the two going together. Over the past few decades, there has been immense development in computer intelligence and exactly zero development in computer consciousness.There is absolutely no reason to think that computers are anywhere near developing consciousness.They might be moving along a very different trajectory than mammalian evolution.In the case ofmammals, evolution has driven mammals toward greater intelligence by way of consciousness, but in the case ofcomputers, they might be progressing along a parallel and very different route to intelligence that just doesn t involve consciousness at all. We may find ourselves in a world with nonconscious super intelligence.The big question is not whether the humans will fall in love with the robots or whether the robots will try to kill the humans.The big question is how does a world of nonconscious super intelligence look ? Because we ve absolutely nothing in history that prepares us for such a scenario. Ezra Klein To me, that is the most interesting question about AI, and the one that I feel is almost always ignored.The reason we solve problems is because feelings drive us.The feeling of anger, the feeling of pain, these lead us to try to solve problems.And at a very base level, there s the drive to reproduce, which is also mediated by feelings of love and lust. So much of , not just human civilization, but the way all animals on Earth seem to operate is trying to secure reproduction for their species.The question that I always am stopped by when I try to imagine AI is what does super intelligence without the basic biological drivers of reproduction look like ? Even if you imagine it would have something like consciousness, it wouldn t have our consciousness. So AI would have powerful intelligence to solve problems, but what would its motivation be ? Why would it want to solve those problems ? Which problems would it want to solve ? I feel so much of the AI conversation assumes that the AI will have the human desire for more, that it will have something and then it will want more things.It will become the best Go player, but it won t be willing to stop there. It will also have to be better than anybody else at Monopoly. It will also have to be better than anyone else at playing Guitar Hero on the PlayStation. But it isn t clear to me that would be true or what would make it true. Yuval Harari In the first generations of AI, you can say that the motivation will be determined by the people who program the AI, but as machine learning kicks off, you really have no idea where it might take the AI.It will not have desires in the human sense because it will not have consciousness.It will not have minds, but it could develop its own patterns of behavior which are way beyond our ability to understand. The whole attraction of machine learning and deep mind and AI for the people in the industry is that the AI can start recognizing patterns and making decisions in a way that no humans can emulate or predict.That means we have no ability to really foresee where the AI will develop.This is part of the danger.The scenarios in which AI goes beyond human intelligence are, by definition, the scenarios that we cannot imagine. Ezra Klein Then why, given the range of uncertainty both about AI development and what an AI would look like, are you so persuaded that human beings will not be a dominant life form in 300 years ? Yuval Harari It s not because I overestimate the AI. It s because most people tend to overestimate human beings.In order to replace most humans, the AI won t have to do very spectacular things. Most of the things the political and economic system needs from human beings are actually quite simple. We earlier talked about driving a taxi or diagnosing a disease.This is something that AI will soon be able to do better than humans even without consciousness, even without having emotions or feelings or super intelligence.Most humans today do very specific things that an AI will soon be able to do better than us. If you go back in time to the hunter - gatherer days, then it s a different story. It would be extremely difficult to build a hunter-gatherer robot that can compete with a human being. But to create a self-driving car that is better than a human taxi driver? That s easy.To create an AI doctor that diagnoses cancer better than a human doctor ? That s easy. What we are talking about in the 21 st century is the possibility that most humans will lose their economic and political value.They will become a kind of massive useless class— useless not from the viewpoint of their mother or of their children, useless from the viewpoint of the economic and military and political system.Once this happens, the system also loses the incentive to invest in human beings. Ezra Klein Let me challenge you on that.Let s say this change takes place over 50, 100, 150 years. Yuval Harari Fifty years is really very quick. Ezra Klein I understand, but it s not necessarily so quick for the economy. A way of saying this is that in 1900, a huge proportion of the American labor force was engaged in farming. By 2000, that was not true at all. Farming was a very tiny percentage of the population as a percentage of workforce. To your point about economic uselessness, we have replaced very useful jobs like farming with a lot of jobs like mine that aren t objectively as useful.Does the world need me doing podcasts and writing articles ? Does it need you writing interesting books about possible futures ? Probably not. What we are good at doing in the economy is telling stories about what we need.We tell stories about the green pieces of paper that form our money, and we tell stories about the value of the things we buy with those green pieces of paper.We manage to convince ourselves that grape juice, if you let it sit around long enough, becomes this amazing thing called wine and can be worth a thousand dollars! We may get to a point where computers are driving taxicabs and we are just telling each other what we really need in life is more yoga teachers and meditation teachers.You can continuously say, Well, then the computer will do that, but I m a little skeptical that we will not be able as a species to find things that we decide add value. I wonder a little bit about the conflation of people being useful with people being valued.Useful is a normative judgment on some level.Value is a story— we decide what has value— and we re good at creating stories about what we want. Yuval Harari I think the answer is on two levels.First of all, with regards to the possibility that new jobs will appear just as farm workers moved to factories and then they moved to services and now they are yoga teachers, the problem here is that humans have basically two kinds of abilities we know about: physical abilities and cognitive abilities. In the past, as machines competed with us in physical abilities in the fields and in the factories, more and more humans moved to working in jobs that require mainly cognitive abilities.Now the machines are starting to compete in the cognitive field as well, and we don t know if a third kind of ability that all of us could move to work in that. Ezra Klein Can I offer one ? Tom Friedman, who is good at putting things in nice little language capsules, like to say we re moving from jobs of the mind to jobs of the heart. It seems to me the ability humans have is that human beings enjoy interacting with other human beings. I could have a computer teach me yoga, but I don t. You re a good example.You are going to a silent meditation retreat for 60 days.Certainly we already have computers that could collate online meditation information, that could read every book ever written about meditation and spit you out a printout, and then you could go off into a room on your own for 60 days and do it for no money— but you want those people, you want those interactions. I actually think a lot of jobs in the economy are like this.I think even now, many jobs are actually useless.Books are in some ways an analogue to computers here— there is so much we could let books do for us that we don t.I believe you teach at a university.You could just have everybody read the books, but people like having teachers.They like having TAs.They like being around other students.What human beings are skilled at, and have been for some time, is interacting with other human beings. Yuval Harari We are likely to see an immense advance in the computer s ability to read and understand human emotions better than humans can do it. If you go to the doctor, you want to have this warm feeling of a human being interacting with you. The way the doctor does it is by reading your facial expressions and your tone of voice and, of course, the contents of your words. These are the three ways in which a human doctor analyzes your emotional state and knows whether you re fearful or bored or angry or whatever. Now, we are not yet there, but we are very close to the point when a computer will be able to recognize these biological patterns better than a human being.Emotions are not some mystical phenomena that only humans can read.In addition, the computer will be able to read signals coming from your body, which no human doctor can do .You can have biometric sensors on or inside your body and the computer will be able to diagnose your exact emotional state much better than any human being.Even in that, AI will have an advantage. The other point is that what happened in the 20 th century is that people who lost their jobs in agriculture got low - skilled jobs in factories, and when these jobs were gone, they got low - skilled jobs in services like being cashiers.The real problem in the 21 st century is that the low - skilled jobs will disappear and we ll have a very big problem retraining people for high-skilled jobs. If you lose your job as a taxi driver when you re, say, 50 years old and you need to reinvent yourself at 50 as a yoga teacher, this is going to be very, very difficult. Ezra Klein The other side of the scenario you re laying out is a world in which what ends up happening is some kind of nonproductive, hyper-pleasure scenario. I honestly worry much more about the VR-dystopia than the AI-dystopia. In a world where people lose their economic utility, it s easy to imagine them retreating into virtual reality, which is already pretty damn good, and will be amazing 20 years from now.Do you imagine a possible future where we are trying to manage the problem of economic irrelevance through a massive societal distraction machine ? Yuval Harari Yes, I think the other problem with AI taking over is not the economic problem, but really the problem of meaning— if you don t have a job anymore and, say, the government provides you with universal basic income or something, the big problem is how do you find meaning in life? What do you do all day? Here, the best answers so far we ve got is drugs and computer games. People will regulate more and more their moods with all kinds of biochemicals, and they will engage more and more with three-dimensional virtual realities. This idea of humans finding meaning in virtual reality games is actually not a new idea.It s a very old idea. We have been finding meaning in virtual reality games for thousands of years. We ve just called it religion until now. You can think about religion simply as a virtual reality game.You invent rules that don t really exist, but you believe these rules, and for your entire life you try to follow the rules. If you re Christian, then if you do this, you get points.If you sin, you lose points.If by the time you finish the game when you re dead, you gained enough points, you get up to the next level. You go to heaven. People have been playing this virtual reality game for thousands of years, and it made them relatively content and happy with their lives.In the 21 st century, we ll just have the technology to create far more persuasive virtual reality games than the ones we ve been playing for the past thousands of years.We ll have the technology to actually create heavens and hells, not in our minds but using bits and using direct brain-computer interfaces",

It s a book about one man s story — a story that is universal in some ways, particular in others, but was certainly not written with Donald J. Trump in mind. I spoke with Vance on a recent episode of my podcast(subscribe here!).Excerpts of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follow. Ezra Klein You ve written a book that became the book of this election cycle. I opened the New York Times a couple weeks ago and they had folks recommending their best books of the year, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, recommended yours. How do you explain what people saw in Hillbilly Elegy that made it so essential to this moment of upheaval in American life? J.D.Vance Part of it is obviously the political moment.Donald Trump became president of the United States, collecting a lot of votes from the white working class, and even though Donald Trump is never mentioned in the book, there s a fair amount in the book about the political, the economic, the social frustrations of the white working class. So if you re hoping to read about a group of people that made Donald Trump or helped make Donald Trump president, then my book gets recommended. I think that s a little bit weird, frankly, given the fact that I really try not to talk about politics too much in the book, but I think folks are just grasping for something to try to understand this political moment, and my book is one of the things that they landed on. And my hope is that the way I talk about these issues, the way I really try to walk somebody through how hard it is to grow up like I did, and to make it in the modern American economy, I m hopeful that that resonated. There s this fear I have that the book will be viewed as this explainer of the Trump phenomenon, which it really isn t, and that the core message, the real reason I wanted to write it, which was to talk about how difficult these problems really are, gets lost.So I think we re in this moment where it s not totally clear what the lasting impact of the book will be, but I hope it s that third factor, this idea that we need to understand what s really going on in the lives of some of these lower - income kids. Ezra Klein I read the book a little bit before Trump became the Republican nominee, and what was striking to me about it then, particularly as it became part of the explanatory toolkit people used for Trump, is that the book is a pretty awkward fit with Trumpism.The explanations you give for things are an awkward fit with where the political class ended up, which is in a sort of Washington fix - it mentality, with the idea that policy has abandoned these Rust Belt towns, that there aren t enough transfer payments, that there s not enough energy going into revitalization. The book was very cultural in its analysis.You have this line early on that seemed to act almost as a thesis statement, that this book is about what goes on in the lives of real people when the industrial economy goes south.It s about reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible.It s about a culture that increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it. It seemed like a book that in some ways resisted policy solutionism in a way that seemed unusual to me, and also seems in tension with the political discussion that emerged around it. J.D.Vance Well, there s definitely an element of truth to that. The one part where I d push back a little bit is that I do think policymakers can do more to address some of these problems, and it s not that I think government is totally helpless. It s more that I think government is somewhat helpful and can be part of the solution, but it can t be the whole solution, and, more importantly, I think that if government tries to fix these problems without policymakers really understanding them, then I think those solutions are almost destined to fail.But there s definitely something a little bit weird about the way the book has been picked to help explain the Trump phenomenon, because, like you said, at the end of the day my argument is not a robust criticism of American trade policy. It s not a strong indictment of the economic policies of President Bush or President Obama. Ezra Klein The book explores resentment you see among the middle class or the working class toward poorer folks.When discussing why the white working class turned toward Republicans, you write: A big part of the explanation lies in the fact that many in the white working class saw precisely what I did, working at Dillman s.As far back as the 1970 s, the white working class began to turn to Richard Nixon because of a perception that, as one man put it, government was payin people who are on welfare today doin nothin !They re laughin at our society!And we re all hardworkin people and we re gettin laughed at for workin every day!' One of the arguments in the book, as I understood it, was that the resentment that powered Trumpism is not just a black - white thing, which I think is how it s often understood, but is actually a class thing that happens even within mostly white communities from one person to another. J.D.Vance Yeah, that s definitely a really important part of my thinking. It s interesting that that passage in the book is sometimes viewed as my criticism of social welfare programs, right ? It s a criticism of food stamps or SNAP or whatever else, and I actually really explicitly meant to be agnostic in that section of the book. I wasn t saying these programs are good or bad. The point I was making is that when you see people using these programs in a certain way, it causes a certain social distrust among the people who may be using them or may be not using them, but certainly don t perceive themselves to be misusing these programs. So I saw this with my grandma, who was a classic Blue Dog Democrat but had grown up in poverty herself, gravitated between working class and impoverished for pretty much her entire life. She had no ideological problem with receiving welfare, and in fact early in her life had been a recipient of welfare herself, but when she saw people buying soda but then selling it at 50 or 60 cents on the dollar to their neighbors so that they could convert those food benefits into cash benefits, it creates a certain amount of social mistrust. And like you said, in our neighborhood it was always white people who were perceived to be misusing these programs.There wasn t a racial element, at least in my personal experience, with this stuff, just because there weren t a whole lot of black people shopping at that grocery store. Ezra Klein Let me ask about how Trump intersects with this.You have a party in the country that is quite focused, particularly when creating transfer programs, on getting as much as possible to the poorest of the poor or the nearly poorest of the poor, and then you have a party in this country that is pretty focused on shrinking the size of government, and Trump walks into the middle of this and offered, I think, a third way. He s pretty pro–safety net, pro–welfare state. He promises not to touch Medicare or Social Security or Medicaid, so he s not a small - government guy.His promise, in contrast to the Democrats, is that he s going to make sure the benefits go to you, the hard-working — and, I think implicitly, white — American, instead of going to, say, these immigrants who are coming across the border. Where does his story intersect here with yours ? J.D.Vance My view on the meaning of Trump is, one, it s complicated, because 60-some-odd million people voted for him, and I think everybody has a different reason for why they voted for him. But my primary conclusion is that Trump identified a problem, and so he got to name it. Trump identified these feelings of being left behind and left out, and the thing he named it was, in some cases, maybe a fear of the other, but a core part of Trump s message, as I understood it, or at least as people back home seemed to be understanding it, is that Trump would bring back jobs, he would bring back good work. Even the immigration issue, whether you agree with him on the policy particulars or not, was framed as a jobs question. The second thing is this question of who are the others that the benefits of the economy are going to, and the message I was getting from Trump, and certainly the message I was getting from Trump voters, is that the other wasn t black Americans living in the inner cities, it wasn t brown Americans immigrating from Mexico— it was the elites.It was the Clintons of the world.It was the Jeb Bushes of the world. Even the way Trump framed this question of the inner cities— as being infested with crime and drugs and whatever else— a lot of African Americans were rightfully offended by the way he described the inner cities, but even then, it s not like he was framing black Americans as the winners of the past 15 or 20 years. He was really framing them as the losers in the same way that he was framing the white working class as the losers, so it always occurred to me that the great enemy of Trump s campaign was never racial minorities.It was always the elites, whoever that is. Ezra Klein There s long been, in liberal circles, the dream of economic solidarity — the idea that there is some way of knitting together a coalition that is the white working class and the multicultural working class, that whether you are working retail in a rural town in Ohio or you re working retail in Los Angeles, whether you re white or Hispanic, you re facing pretty similar issues. Trump was actually able to create, instead of the us of a united working class, a them of elites plus multiculturalism.He certainly wasn t framing African Americans as the winners of the last couple years, but it was that elites are colluding to create this multicultural America where people are allowed to come across the border because it s cheap labor for corporations, and you re the one who s ending up paying. J.D.Vance It s interesting, too, the way the immigration side of this has manifested itself in my own life. I have very close family members who are extremely, one, generous, and two, involved with a family of undocumented immigrants, and these family members are devoted, devoted Trump people, the types of people who have Make America Great Again trucker hats. If you ask these family members of mine why they re voting for Trump despite the fact that, at least if you take him literally, he may very well deport these people that they consider very close friends and that they love a great deal, the response is always, He s not going to deport them.What he s going to do is fix the system that forces them to live in the shadows. He s going to fix the system that allows other people to get ahead of them in line. So even when it s taken to the part of Trump s message that is explicit as possible, which is that undocumented immigrants are an unacceptable strain on American society, you see his voters reinterpreting it in a way that, whether they re right or they re wrong, I think that there s something actually quite admirable about the way they perceive what he s going to do and how it motivates their voting. Ezra Klein There s a good line — and it s not from me, it s from someone else — that you did not, by any means, need to be a bigot to vote for Donald Trump, and I think the majority of people who did vote for Trump are not bigots, but there are certain things you need to be okay with that were a lot harder for folks of color to treat as lightly. It does take a kind of position of privilege to say, Hey, I m pretty sure that won t happen, so I m not going to worry about it. There is a risk tolerance that, depending on who you are in this discussion, I think, feels very different and can feel very frustrating.I remember thinking a lot during the campaign that if what Trump had said was that Jewish people should not be able to travel to and from the United States, if he had come out and said, I m for a Jewish travel ban, whatever I thought about him winning, I would have left the country.That speaks to an ancient fear in myself and my people.But a lot of Muslim folks didn t have that option, and a lot of people around them took it as, Oh, take Trump seriously, not literally, but the question of who gets to decide when he s serious versus when he s being literal is, I think, a very hard one. J.D.Vance Yeah, I agree.The point about risk tolerance for some of the things that Trump said, I think, is a very important one.It s something I ve tried to talk about with my family a lot, that if we maybe looked a little bit different, if our names were a little bit different, then maybe we wouldn t be so tolerant of some of the things he said. We wouldn t be so willing to cast it aside and say that s not really what he means or that s not really what he thinks.The complicating factor, of course, is that people weren t voting a binary yes or no Trump. They were necessarily voting, if not for Trump, then for Hillary Clinton. The framing I have always had to this is that there s both a substance and a process element to Trump. There s the things that he says, the policies, such as they are, that he hopes to enact.That s the substantive part of Trump, but then there s the process part of Trump, which is a criticism of the elites, a criticism of the way we engage in political discourse, a criticism, specifically, of the Clintons and especially Hillary Clinton.And my sense is that the process side of Trump was very appealing to a lot of people even as the substantive side of him was at least a little bit disconcerting, even to a lot of his voters. Ezra Klein That s a very interesting point. I almost want to stop the podcast for 10 minutes and think about it, because there are times when I felt the opposite, where I wondered if somebody with Trump s ideas and his policies who did not have many of his process and temperamental dimensions wouldn t have even done better. I guess one way of thinking about it is, are the people you know, are the people around you, are they upset about the fact that Trump has brought so many folks from Goldman Sachs and CEOs from other companies into his office ? If this was a backlash to a globalized elite, it would seem that what he s doing would anger people, but that s not really been the feeling I ve gotten. J.D.Vance No, that s not been the feeling I ve gotten either.There s always been this element with Trump where a lot of people feel that he s peeling the onion back and showing them how the world actually works and giving them some perspective into a part of our political and financial process that usually lays hidden. With Cabinet picks, I ve never been surprised that they ve never engendered the backlash that you might suspect.A lot of folks feel like this is the way that business is done.Trump is showing us the processes and the functions of government, and what he ll ultimately be judged on is if things actually change. Ezra Klein To bring Trump back to your book, one of the things that is core to his portrayal of his own life is that he is the agent of his own story, he is the main character, he is somebody who, whatever he decides to do, it just gets done.You write in your book that whenever people ask me what I d most like to change about the white working class, I say, ‘The feeling that our choices don t matter. That struck me as an interesting juxtaposition. The person who, of everybody I ve ever seen in public life, seems to believe that his personal choices matter the most, is appealing to a group in which, at least as you describe it, is afflicted by a sense that the everyday choices have stopped having meaning. J.D.Vance I ve never thought of that before, but it definitely makes a great deal of sense. This is something that I worry a lot about in the book and the way I frame it is a sort of learned helplessness, this constant feeling of being kicked by the economy, by your boss, by your family. I don t think that view comes from nothing, but it can be pretty self - destructive once it sets in . It is fascinating to think of Donald Trump as a sort of clarion call against that self - defeatism.And yeah, there s something powerful about feeling a little hopeless and a little powerless in your own life but then seeing this political figure who explains why you feel hopeless and powerless but is so powerful in his own right. Ezra Klein One of the things your book is talking about is that not all white people are the same.Your book is talking about a particular lineage of Scots - Irish folks who settled primarily in certain parts of the country, have distinct cultural markers and patterns than other people do, and have not done as well, income - wise.So when they hear about white privilege, they think, Fuck you. Nothing about my community says to me that I m privileged and should be at the back of the line for getting some help here. I m curious how you think about that playing out and how you hear it in the conversation. J.D.Vance First of all, I think it s one of the ways that the thesis of the book, or at least some of the background arguments I make in the book, is really relevant to the 2016 election. I remember right after the Iowa primary, a political scientist did basically an ethnographic breakdown of Trump versus Cruz versus Rubio in the Iowa caucuses, and what he found — and I m going to overstate this, maybe, because I haven t seen this study in nearly a year — is that one of the, if not the biggest, correlations to Trump support was identifying as Scots-Irish or one of its derivatives. I really thought that was a massively underreported part of this election cycle.I really think that s why he won Pennsylvania, Michigan, and, to a smaller extent, Wisconsin — if you look at the migration patterns, the white working-class populations of those areas are heavily Scots-Irish. But to connect it to the conversation about white privilege, I think it s always important to note that there are obviously still advantages to being white, there are still disadvantages to being black, even when you control completely for class, income, and so forth. But one of the points I tried to make is that if you re asking the son of an unemployed West Virginia coal miner to check his privilege or to appreciate the ways in which, let s say, Barack Obama s daughters are going to be privileged or underprivileged relative to him in certain ways, I think that you re asking just too much from basic human cognition. That kid cannot look at his life and say about a group of people that he doesn t understand, that he doesn t even interact with a lot day to day, that their lives are much worse than his, and I think that s one of the things that the modern discourse around racial privilege and racial disadvantage misses. I don t think most of the people making these arguments are that reductive, I think they re a lot more sophisticated in what they re saying[about] how privilege operates along different dimensions in our society, but the way it s actually talked about appears very reductive, and I think that s a really significant problem. Ezra Klein You have a stat in the book that working - class whites are currently the most pessimistic group in America.You write that they re more pessimistic than Latino immigrants, many of whom suffer unthinkable poverty. They re more pessimistic than black Americans whose material prospects continue to lag behind those of whites.' If you are a white kid whose father is unemployed and you re in a struggling majority-white community, and you re turning on the television and the president is an African American, and you re looking at sitcoms and they re suddenly much, much, much more diverse and nobody you see talks like you do, nobody has the accent you do, nobody has the cultural markers you do, it s hard, then, to hear that white privilege is the problem. On the other hand, you could not have somebody like Trump, but was African American, elected president in this country.He is walking white privilege. J.D.Vance The problem, as I see it, is that we haven t necessarily developed a great vocabulary to describe disadvantage in a newer, much more culturally diverse country. One of the things I hope that a reader of my book will take away is that it really operates among multiple different axes, so it s a function of where you grew up, it s a function of whether you grew up in concentrated poverty, it s a function of your race, it s a function of your class, it s a function of the education level of your parents, it s a function of how much childhood trauma you faced, it s a function of whether your parents are single or still married. I really think we have to catch our collective vocabulary up to the real complexity of these problems, because if we don t, we re left effectively talking about the issue in incredibly reductive ways that, one, isn t helpful for the reasons you describe, but two, I really think discolors the public debate in a certain way. It s not just that talking to that kid about white privilege is not an especially useful way to understand his real disadvantage.It s that it actually makes it harder for him to see the disadvantages that other people face. Ezra Klein Let me ask you about the other side of this.I hear everything you just said there, and then you talk to somebody who s African American and they say the quantity of cultural sympathy that is being directed toward Trump voters is overwhelming. The idea that they always need to be understood better, that there need to be more and more and more sympathetic profiles, that s not true for folks who were followers, say, of Louis Farrakhan, who also had his bigoted moments but was speaking to a very real sense of cultural dislocation and economic anxiety and frustration and feeling that communities are falling apart. Or, even less provocatively, that s not true folks who are seeing police brutality in a pretty routine way in their communities, or who look at the studies and see that if you ve got a stereotypically African - American name you re just less likely to be called back for a job. All of a sudden when it s a problem for a traditionally powerful community, there needs to be a level of precision that the marginalized community never got and a level of sympathy they never got, and that holds back the conversation in a different way. J.D.Vance One of the things I try to do inmy book is to be very sympathetic about the way in which these various structural problems make it very hard on the white working - class community, but also to be a little bit hardheaded about the ways in which white working - class Americans— not all of them, of course, not even most of them, but certainly some of them— have reacted to these problems in a very negative way.And I think if we have sympathy completely disconnected from moral judgment, I don t think it s real sympathy.I think it s basically the sympathy of an outsider that s condescending to make people feel good. The way I see that in the African - American community is almost the exact opposite, so typically if we talk about culture in the black community, at least with regards to the problems of the black community, it s almost always in this morally condemnatory way — it s like, let s look at these pathological black people and all of the problems that their culture causes them.And I think that way of talking has been incredibly destructive, and it s been destructive in two separate ways. One, it s allowed us to ignore the problems of black Americans where we should be really paying attention to them, and two, I think it has caused us to talk about culture in a way that s about judgment and blame and not about understanding.Because I think if you look at some of the best sociologists and political scientists and so forth who are writing on this, William Julius Wilson, Robert Putnam, these guys are worried about culture; they re just not worried about culture in a way that necessarily percolates to the standard everyday political conversation. So I think that s a real casualty of the way that we ve typically talked about so-called black pathology in the inner cities. To tie all this up, my view of this is that we should continue to offer sympathetic but hard - nosed looks at the white working - class community, and we should maybe pair that with more sympathetic views of what s going on in the black community. Ezra Klein I think one thing that is a contributor here is that we have trouble talking about problems that are non - economic.We have a language for economic problems, but particularly when it comes to people discussing what s happening in white working-class communities, a lot of the problems are not the ones that come through first on an economic test. There are things showing that Trump voters had a higher median income than the average American household, and that doesn t mean that their communities don t have problems, but it does make a straightforward discussion of economic anxiety a little bit hard. You gave an interview to Slate, and you had a really nice language around this, I thought, where you talked about social and cultural anxiety, and for these communities you diagnosed it as a feeling that the world around you is falling apart.It s not just you can t find a good job, but that your kids are dying of opioid overdoses, that your families are breaking apart, that churches are not really present in your community, that you can t trust the media.' I think we have a difficult time measuring and discussing more complex, multifaceted forms of breakdown, where we can t just say, Hey, look, the unemployment rate has gone up to 9.6 percent, and so there s clearly a crisis here. J.D.Vance I agree 100 percent with that.And I think a lot about why that is, about why we re so bad about talking about non-economic problems, and I think it s partially just a symptom of the fact that our public discourse is really dominated by what I ll call the technocratic left and the libertarian right, and so we want to see these problems purely in terms of rational actors responding to incentives. If you re not talking about social and cultural capital, if you re not talking about the role of religion, which can be either positive or negative in these communities, as I write about, if you re not talking about the role of childhood trauma and family instability, these are things that are real, and if you look at the data they definitely affect these kids life prospects.If you look at a study like Raj Chetty s, for example, he did this huge study on equality of opportunity in the United States, and you can make a very good argument that the two most important things he identified as driving mobility differences were social capital and family breakdown. Ezra Klein There s a dimension of the technocratic left, and I ll use Hillary Clinton here as an example, that is very focused on these problems but cannot seem to communicate effectively about them. I interviewed Clinton during the campaign, and a question I asked her was to name some of her favorite books.And the two books she named that she was thinking about a lot on the campaign trail were Robert Putnam s Our Kids — which is a deep, ethnographic look at the ways in which culture and lived experience and community are really tearing apart the futures for kids who are born in poor communities and kids of all races — and Habits of the Heart, which is all about community breakdown, about the role religion does or doesn t play in our lives. Trump, I think, has no idea that Robert Putnam has written a book called Our Kids and is not deeply thoughtful, frankly, on a lot of the way these things overlap and interact, but he had some capacity to say, I am on your side, and that was what people responded to. J.D.Vance Well, I definitely agree with you that this capacity to form a connection is one of the clear critical problems that a lot of our politicians face these days.It strikes me that not spending a lot of time in these areas, not living in these areas, not campaigning in these areas, that sort of drives the difficulty in connecting.And to put a very fine point on it, I think just because of the way upper - middle - class elites educate themselves, the way they intermarry, the way they work and where they live and so forth, is just really driving this wedge further and further. It may not be that Hillary Clinton could have solved the problem by campaigning more in rural Pennsylvania or suburban southwest Ohio.The problem may just be that she spent so long among a certain class of society, and that class of society is just not good at emotionally connecting with another class of society— and here I m speaking of the elites versus the broad middle — and I unfortunately just do not have the answer to that problem. It s something that really, really bothers me— this fear that those who are doing especially well in our society, for one reason or another, that they ve lost touch with those who don t feel that they re doing especially well in our society.",

The campaign between the two men is increasingly seen as a new front in the fight between the Sanders and Clinton wings of the party— but that s a bit absurd. The position they re running for is more operational than ideological. I recently had Ellison on my podcast, and I wanted to draw him out on the specifics of his vision for the job.What powers does the DNC chair have ? How does Ellison want to use them ? What is his philosophy of party organizing ? How does a party— as opposed to a candidate— build a relationship with voters ? What should the national party apparatus be doing in off years ? How much confrontation should there be with Donald Trump ? We get into the weeds of party building here, and it s obviously a topic Ellison has thought about a lot — both in his own campaigns and in his run for DNC chair. The Democratic Party has some hard choices to make in the coming years, and so it s well worth hearing where Ellison wants to push it.You can listen to our podcast conversation here, or subscribe on iTunes.A transcript of our discussion, edited for length and clarity, follows. Why have Democrats lost so much down - ballot strength during Obama s presidency ? Ezra Klein We re talking a night after President Obama gave his farewell address. Last I looked at Obama s polling, which was a day or two ago, he s at 56 percent [popularity]. He s leaving office a very popular president. Keith Ellison He sure is. Ezra Klein He s more popular than Ronald Reagan was when he left office. At the same time, over the past eight years, Democrats share of seats in the US Senate has fallen from 59 to 48. They ve lost 62 House seats, 12 governorships, and, this is the number that I keep getting caught up on, 958 seats in state legislatures.Why do you think that is ? Keith Ellison I think the reason that we ve had those losses is because the DNC is viewed more as a presidential campaign apparatus rather than a program or an agency designed to get Democrats elected up and down the ballot all the time. The DNC really should be the instrument for the rank-and-file Democrat all over the country — in Idaho, in Chicago, in Minneapolis, in Florida. But we treat it like it s not the Democratic National Committee; we treat it like it s the Democratic Presidential National Committee. Because of that, we have not really had the outreach and the door knocking and the engagement year-round that we need to have. That s too bad. The thing is that before 2008, we had the 50 - state strategy, and that is in fact still pretty popular among DNC members.As you notice, we did pretty well in 2006; we did pretty well in 2008. I think that s because we still had enough connectivity in place from that 50-state strategy, but as time wore on, the tremendous popularity of Barack Obama, his amazing rhetorical skills, his just unparalleled ability to explain things and to inspire people really is the fuel that we lived on. Because of that, we lost a lot. At the same time, Republicans made some strategic decisions....There are articles before 2010 where Karl Rove is saying, We ve got this new thing called Maptitude, or this new software that s helping us identify places of opportunity. We re going to be going into the small towns. We re going to Erie, Pennsylvania. We re going to Peoria, Illinois. We re going to get competitive at the very local level. Also there was massive investment by the Koch brothers.As we were focusing on our champion, President Obama, the other side was actually thinking creatively about how they can really dominate on the state level and on the local level.Those two things together gave us some unprecedented losses.I m going to tell you though, Ezra, we can come back. We absolutely can. We just have to refocus our game plan, but if we do, 2018 and 2020 can be years of great promise. Ezra Klein I d like to hear about that. I d like to be very specific and operational, mechanical, because I think that s something that gets lost when we talk about the DNC chair race.You re running for DNC chair. Keith Ellison Yes, I am. Ezra Klein It is being understood and covered as an ideological contest.I think that s fair to say. Keith Ellison That s too bad, though. Ezra Klein It s an operational position more than an ideological position. That s what I wanted to talk about.What are the levers you have as DNC chair to pull ? What are the mechanisms you think would work here ? What literal policies would you change from how the DNC works now that would make it less the Democratic Presidential Committee and more the Democratic National Committee ? Keith Ellison Well, first thing is, if I win, right away we re going to start with an attitudinal change around turnout. Voter turnout has got to be something that is on the mind of every rank-and-file Democrat, every Democratic officeholder. We must, in terms of turnout, think in terms of expanding the electorate beyond the people who are the likely voters in the swing states. Turnout has got to be key. When I was elected in 2006, my district had the lowest turnout in the state of Minnesota.Now it s the highest, and it s consistently the highest.One of the reasons why is because we focus on turnout 365 days of year. Ezra Klein When you say you focus on it, what do you specifically do ? Keith Ellison We have an apartment program.We found out that you if knock on a door one day and you come back in a year, there s a 50/50 chance that person doesn t even live there anymore.If you don t go there except for election time, there s an even greater chance— a 50 percent chance of a 50 percent chance after two years. There are hundreds of apartment buildings in the Fifth Congressional District.I ve got staff that identified all of them that have more than around five or six units. Then we make contact with the managers of all of them. We got captains in them. Then in the off year, we knock them. We have meetings there. Then when some people don t want to be bothered, that s why they live in an apartment, the management will be able to tell them, The politicians are going to be knocking today, so if you don t want them to knock, put up a sign on your door. The other thing we do inevery year off year is a massive summer knock.We knock all year round, but we have a special, massive summer knock, where we get a whole bunch of college students and pair them with our paid staff.Last summer, in 2015, we had 9, 000 conversations.It took us about 30, 000 tries to get those 9, 000 conversations, but we collected data.We cleaned up our list.We got back in touch with people.We sent them an important signal, which is that we don t just care about you when we want your vote. We care about you and want to have an ongoing, durable relationship with you. That kind of thing people remember. Then, of course, we would do a lot of things in between, regular pizza parties, coffee klatches.I have the biggest Labor Day picnic in Minnesota.We have a get - out - the - vote concert with our rap community right before the election. The real idea is not the big events.The real idea is the canvassing, the door knocking, the calling.Then the other thing we do is we continually ask people to help us.We re asking people, There s a vote coming up.What do you think ? There s a vote coming up. What s your opinion ? Sign up on this petition.Sign up on that petition. People are constantly feeling like they re partnering with me as the member of Congress from their district. That s why not only do I win with a high percentage — my predecessor won with a high percentage — but I don t even care about the percentage.I care about the raw numbers that we are turning out.When I first got into office, I had 150, 000 votes.Now if we don t get 250,000 votes, we feel disappointed. Because we got 250,000 this year and we got 262,000 in 2012. There are no statewide Republicans in Minnesota.Not any, not one.Amy Klobuchar, Al Franken, Democrats.Mark Dayton, our governor, Democrat; Attorney General Lori Swanson, Democrat.We don t have no statewide Republicans. We used to. You remember Tim Pawlenty, who used to be the governor, and you remember Norm Coleman. Why can t a Norm Coleman or a Tim Pawlenty get back into statewide office ? Because in the Fifth Congressional District, we spike the vote so high they cannot get in. I ll give you another example of what I m talking about here.Steve Simon s the secretary of state for the state of Minnesota.When he ran in 2014, he was the only incumbent.The Republicans put a lot of energy into that, because they figured if they can beat him, that would be their chance to win a statewide office.They actually did beat Steve in five of eight congressional districts, but we beat them so bad in the Fifth Congressional District that we still won.That s the kind of thing that we do. In 2014, voter turnout statewide decreased in the state of Minnesota from 2010, hitting a 70 - year low.In my district, we increased turnout by 3 percent in 2014. Even in down years, we re going up. It s the only congressional district in Minnesota, the fifth district, where voter turnout grew between 2010 and 2014. That s what we re doing, and that s why I think I need to be the DNC chair. Ezra Klein Those are very impressive numbers, and particularly the point about 2014 turnout increasing in your district.That s an achievement. But you keep saying the word we. I recognize that you mean your campaign staff, all your volunteers, the college kids. But in your congressional district, what is being organized around is you. In American politics in general, one reason presidential years have so much higher turnout than midterm years, to say nothing of non-election periods, is that people find it easier to connect with the presidential candidate. Neither political party in the country is actually a popular institution.People don t like Republicans. They don t like Democrats.Right now we have the highest share of independents as a share of the electorate that we ve basically ever had. How do you create that connection, then, on behalf of an institution? How do you give people something they connect to when it s not Keith Ellison, this nice guy who maybe knocked on your door a couple of years back, but it s the Democratic Party? Keith Ellison We give them the personalities.For example, we re going to be doing regular live streaming straight to Democratic rank-and-file members, which is something we re not doing now.Who are we going to give them ? We re going to give them Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and all these engaging personalities. We re going to give them Cedric Richmond.We re going to give them Barbara Lee. We re going to give them those people that they watch on the TV shows and love and want to hear about.We re going to give them the union president in Indiana who stood up to Donald Trump. Here we live in the age of Trump.This guy, the most misogynistic candidate, beats the first woman candidate.This is devastating to women in this country, and men too, but we re going to feature women in these live casts and talk about equal pay, access to reproductive care. Talk about how the economic fortunes of a family are directly connected to reproductive access and the Hyde Amendment. We have to face the facts that the Republicans have out - organized us.They simply have.I know it s true because I got a good friend of mine who was a Republican, now a Democrat. She s a city council member in Northfield, Minnesota.She will say, Man, when I was Republican and I was a city council member, they connected me. I was part of this. I was part of that. I was on calls. I got data. I got talking points. Now that I m a Democrat city council member, I feel better about my soul because this is what I believe in, but you guys don t stay that closely in touch with us. My thought is that s the challenge. We ve got to match them organizationally, and then we put some of these dynamic personalities in front of people.People will begin to think, when they think Democrat, they re thinking Franklin Roosevelt. They re thinking Hubert H.Humphrey.They re thinking Barack Obama, who has 57 percent approval rating. That s the thing.I don t think we feature our people well enough. Ezra Klein You mentioned talking points, organizing, and getting more people on shows.That s the communications side of it. But something that has happened on the Republican side in states and in cities has been the creation of a much more aggressive, substantive agenda for state legislators, for local city council members. People hear about groups like ALEC [the American Legislative Exchange Council], but there s a lot of it.The playbook of what to do if you suddenly have power in a state and you re a Republican is much more aggressive and fully formed. You have states where Democrats have a lot of power, California being an example, but you don t see an aggressive, reproducible agenda emergent there. Is that something you think is a strength or weakness of Democrats? Is it good that Democrats are not sitting around moving legislation from one state to another? Or do Democrats in the states need to make it much clearer what they are going to do if you elect them? Keith Ellison I have no doubt that it s a weakness. What is the root of that weakness? We re highly siloed.We are highly siloed.One of the things we have got to do is to create a truly national coordinated campaign committee.Now, I m not saying that US House people are going to tell the US Senate what to do or that Democratic municipal officeholders are going to tell the state legislators what to do, but we have got to have some sort of working coordination. For example, just look at voting rights.The Republicans are so coordinated that the day after Shelby County gets struck by the Supreme Court, which is also part of their coordination, their legislative arm, because it s clearly one body, shoots out proposed legislation on everything from getting rid of early voting to pushing a photo ID to saying that 17-year-olds can t register even if they re going to be 18 by the election. They ve done this all over the country and in an amazingly coordinated fashion. I do not believe that Democrats have identified the fact that voter expansion has to be a strategic goal of ours, and yet Republicans clearly are aware that voter suppression must be a strategic goal of theirs.They re actively suppressing the vote. They re doing it in 50 states.They re doing it with a PR program. They re doing it with a state legislative program.They re doing it with a city program, just simply not enough voting machines. They re doing it with a legal program.What are we doing ? We re doing state by state. Oregon s doing great work, but what about others ? This should be 50 pieces of legislation introduced in all states that expand the vote.That s clearly what we need to be doing. The DNC has to help do that. What if we just got every so - called state seat Democrat, and we got every senator that is up, we got them all in a room together and said, You guys talk and figure out how that state seat Democrat, just by increasing turnout in their own district, can help you win statewide. Those conversations haven t been happening. Who s going to help coordinate that conversation ? I think the DNC should be part of that. Are Democrats too focused on identity politics' ? Ezra Klein If you take over the Democratic National Committee, you re going to be in leadership of a party that is trying to work its way through some pretty deep fissures right now. One is the Bernie Sanders/Hillary Clinton fissure from the primary, which has not healed. But beneath that cleavage is an argument that you ve begun hearing play out in more and more explicit terms about whether Democrats in the modern era focus too much on what some people call identity politics. Some people feel that Democrats have become too focused on calling out acts of racism, have become too focused on giving one thing to each of the different groups that are in the Democratic coalition as opposed to having a more singular message around economic policy.I m curious how you navigate that debate. Keith Ellison I think the DNC needs to point out repeatedly that if we don t have social inclusion, we won t have economic inclusion either.Ronald Reagan, right before his election in 1980, goes to Philadelphia, Mississippi, where Schwerner, Chaney, Goodman were murdered and buried in the earthen dam, and gives a speech on states rights. Now, everybody in America who s cracked their history book knows exactly what he s doing. He s dog - whistling racism.He s telling white, Southern men that he s on their side against their black neighbors.That s what he s doing.Well, as soon as Reagan gets in , one of the first things he does is fires the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, and that helps begin the flattening of the American wage for working people. There are many examples where politicians sow division between people, and then when they get in power they suppress the wages of all people who labor every day to make a living.That is a recurring thing.We have got to help people understand that, for example, when we were maybe at our best, the March on Washington was the march for jobs and civil rights, and Walter Reuther and Martin Luther King were together.When we re at our best, we are that rainbow coalition. We recognize that whether you are gay or transgender, you ve got to earn a living, whether you re a white male in Tennessee, you ve got to earn a living.That s the reality for all of us. Ezra Klein Let me push you on this a little bit.People hear that answer and then what they think is, But it feels zero-sum to me. It feels that immigrants coming over the border are taking my jobs. And it s not always racial.One of my colleagues, Sarah Kliff, she went up to Kentucky.She was talking to people who voted for Donald Trump but were on Obamacare.One of the things they said was, I m pissed off about the folks who are poorer than me, who don t work, and who get Medicaid. They don t have these high deductibles that I have. They don t all this cost sharing that I have. One of the things that Donald Trump spoke to with great effectiveness is the feeling people have that the pie is only so big, which there are times when it is.For instance, with government programs oftentimes.That what maybe could go to them or could go to their community or could go to their family is instead going to someone else .What Trump did for a lot of white Americans is he came and said, I m going to make sure it goes to you. I m going to make sure these people aren t coming over and taking it from you. When you say you need social inclusion, I think what a lot of people hear is, We re going to bring in all these folks, and those slices of the pie are going to get a lot smaller.' Keith Ellison See, that s why we ve got to be in people s doorways and at people s VFW halls and we got to be talking to them.Because I would say, you show me a Southern, a white person in Kentucky who voted for Trump and is now worrying about their Obamacare taken away, I ll show you a person who Democrats haven t even knocked on their door in years.I ll show you some people who haven t been talked to.They haven t heard the other side of the story. Because I m going to tell you right now, if they framed resource allocation as a basic issue of scarcity, we going to lose that one.There s not enough. Obviously you re going to pick you and your family over somebody you don t know and have heard a lot of bad things about. Here s the reality of it. There is enough in America, man. There is enough. Now, there s not enough if we give the richest people the lowest tax rates, like the hedge fund managers.There s not enough if we let some people hoard massive amounts of wealth overseas because of the deferral provision in our tax code. There s not enough then.If you can get a tax break for your plane and your jet and all that, there may not be enough then.If we had even a tax code like the one we had in 1975, we could make sure that the rich get to keep their money, but everybody else can make it too.Once they got you in the scarcity frame, they got you over a barrel.It s easy then to work racial, ethnic, gender, age division. What if we did have a tiny sales tax on stock trades, derivatives, and bonds like we used to before the mid - 1960 s, like so many other countries around the world do ?What if we put it all into higher ed ? That s my point. What if we just ended deferral, make them folks pay taxes on that money? See, those conversations got to be had, because those folks in Kentucky are smart, but they can t know what they ve never been exposed to. They can t be exposed to the idea if we ve never brought it to them. That s my argument.We ve got to go to the people. We ve got to talk to the people.You can t expect an overnight flip, but you will get the change you re looking for if you stick and you stay and you gain people s trust. That s why we got to have a Democratic Party that is 50 states, that is 365 days a year, that is focused on building out at the county level and the state level, and that moves resources from DC to the locations closest to the actual voter. Then we ve got to reorient our thinking around turnout as opposed to just getting a higher percentage in the election than our opponent.We do have to do some soul searching, but it is what s in our grasp to do. How should Democrats define themselves ? Ezra Klein Hillary Clinton had, I may get the exact number wrong here, but it was something like 44 policies.As somebody who read a bunch of those policies, I can tell you that those policies had sub - policies, and the sub - policies had sub - policies.A lot of the things that you re talking about here, they re even in there.On the other hand, Donald Trump had seven, at least for a long period of time.Two of them were repeated— he had an immigration policy and then a building - the - wall policy. I saw that and thought, This is absurd.'You rethink it, and you say the logic.Where a lot of people, I think, didn t quite know what Hillary Clinton stood for, people knew Donald Trump wanted to build the wall, wanted to cut taxes, wanted to screw with China. That s what he was going to do .I guess I d ask you, when you think about defining the Democratic Party to people, when you think about being in that doorway and you ve only got a couple seconds really, a couple of minutes at most, what three ideas do you want to define the Democratic Party ? Keith Ellison The Democratic Party is for economic inclusion.Your family ought to make a living too.The Democratic Party is for everybody being respected, liberty and justice for all.I just got two. Ezra Klein Those are values.Give me the policies.What are you saying will be done ? Keith Ellison We re going to raise your wages. We re going to have a fair trade model.We re going to make it so you cannot be discriminated against based on who you are. We re going to get rid of mass incarceration.We re going to invest in our infrastructure as a country, really, not how Trump says. Those things are simple. Guess what? There was a candidate who talked in simple language and got a lot of support in the last election. Ezra Klein Are you talking here about Bernie Sanders ? Keith Ellison Yeah. Ezra Klein Tell me a bit about how you read the aftermath of the Sanders campaign and how you think about the fight within the party around Bernie Sanders and what he represented and what he didn t represent. He did, as you say, get a lot of support, but he didn t win the primary.There s a real feeling on behalf of his backers that he clearly would ve won the general election.How do you think about that ? Keith Ellison I m one of those who says I don t know.I think Hillary Clinton was a great candidate.I m very proud of her candidacy. I will say this: Speaking in a few clear points and then repeating those points is good campaigning. There s no doubt about that.There s a lot of reasons why Hillary Clinton didn t win.In fact, she got more votes than the other side, but if you want to talk about in the Midwest, with Michigan, Wisconsin, and so forth, I think she was put in a very difficult position because of the president s advocacy of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It was just hard for her to get people to believe her on trade, even though I believed her. I was honored to support her because I believed her. To just say Bernie would ve won — I don t know if Bernie would ve won, but I can tell you this. There s no doubt that clear messaging is critical to electoral success.That s why when people ask me what does the Democratic Party stand for, well, it stands for inclusion, economically, making sure your family can make a good living, and it s for respect for all.Those are two simple ideas to me. Ezra Klein One thing that I ve thought a bit about is that people limit this argument to Sanders and Clinton. But down ballot, you can see a lot of different lessons in there. You have Jason Kander in Missouri who ran 15 points, I think it was, ahead of Hillary Clinton but was a more conservative candidate. You have Russ Feingold in Wisconsin, who is a real tribune of progressive politics but didn t do better than Clinton. Are there lessons in the election that actually the Democratic Party, if it wants to be more competitive in Michigan and more competitive in Pennsylvania, needs to worry about moving too far to the left? Keith Ellison See, I don t think it s a left or right thing.I really don t. I think that if we engage a real, substantive relationship with the voters, a lot of these ideological questions get sorted out on their own. I believe that in Arizona they passed an increase in the minimum wage and got rid of [Sheriff Joe] Arpaio. I think in Arizona, Trump still won. The cities in Texas went blue. Harris County went blue. Dallas County went blue. San Antonio went blue. Austin went blue. They are knocking on the door. In Georgia, they did pretty well. In North Carolina, we won the governorship, should ve won the senatorship. I would say that where we won, we won because people really knocked on the door, 365 days a year, and were unrelenting talking about what the Democratic Party was about.Then the other thing they did is allow people the space to say, We re the Georgia Democratic Party. We re the Tennessee Democratic Party. We re the Arizona Democratic Party. They allowed for local differentiation, which I think is just fine.We don t need to have a cookie cutout. We don t care if they localize the flavor as long as the core ideas are still there. I think that if you get beneath the surface, there are some important lessons to be learned.That lesson in my opinion is we got to reemphasize field.We don t need to get rid of television, but we need to reconceive of how we do it. We need to campaign 365 days a year. We ve got to integrate all of our assets so that we re not so highly siloed. That s what I think the lessons are. Can there be decency in politics in the age of Trump ? Ezra Klein I ve been thinking a lot about a tweet Donald Trump sent on new year s morning.He said, Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don t know what to do. Love!' Before Trump was elected, before this whole election, when it was President Obama and it was Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we already at that moment would ve said, America is bitterly, deeply divided. We re divided by politics. We are talking a lot more recently about our divisions around race. This is already a powder keg of a time. Now you have a president coming in who is modeling a politics of petty viciousness in a way that I haven t actually seen, who as a strategy, wants to keep his opponents in a continuous state of distracted outrage.And it s all happening on these social networks that really incentivize nasty behavior from us.Everyone I know is on Twitter.I think we are all worse people on Twitter than we are in real life. I recognize how much this makes me sound like an old man before my time, but I worry the incentives to really make politics a cruel and un - empathetic and angry and vengeful place are getting stronger, and that behavior is going to be modeled in a way that s going to make it feel very okay. To use a word people like using now, it s going to be normalized from the top.I m wondering if you think about this, and if so, how you think about navigating through it. Keith Ellison Oh yeah.Let me tell you.I am worried about this because I know that there have been many times in American history when politics was particularly vitriolic.1850 s come to mind.See my point ? Ezra Klein I do see your point.That doesn t make me feel better. Things went pretty bad. Keith Ellison Right.We have been in points of American history when Americans have been at each other pretty bad.It s been actually worse than now. I think the real thing is that leaders who keep the core principles of the nation in mind are particularly necessary in moments like this. I don t know if Henry Clay helped history or just delayed history, but he kept the states from having a war.He did it on the backs of some people, African Americans, but there s been a number of times in American history when we ve had bitter conflict.In the 1930 s, thank goodness, we had leaders like Roosevelt and, even more important than him, people like Frances Perkins.Franklin Roosevelt was bitterly attacked, by the way.It was nasty. I guess what I have to say is that the DNC has to appeal to people s better nature, has to talk to people around things that are actually going to improve their lives. The DNC has to understand that emotion drives choice and that if all we do is spit a bunch of facts at people, that they may not get it because emotion really does drive choices. Fear makes people reflect less, and it also makes them concede to authoritarian leadership more. The thing is, I m running for DNC chair because I think this is a moment where real patriots have to consider the best interests of their nation.I think trying to heal our country is a duty of love, honestly. Ezra Klein What do you think you shouldn t do as DNC chair, then? What are going to be the hard decisions that need to be made in this era to heal? Keith Ellison How we heal all turns back to figuring out what s ailing us, right? I think the real cause of the pain that America is in is 40 years of the economy tilting dramatically against working people. The reason I think that s the problem is because I think what ends up happening is that then people at the top of the economy, like Donald Trump, who want to maintain privilege and hierarchy then appeal to Americans based on division in order to maintain power. I think in some ways, it is the inequality that helps fuel the negativity.To me, rebuilding the Democratic Party to get us back in the game, to get us winning some elections where we can really stand up for some policies that are more equitable, where we can really experience shared prosperity, will actually lessen some of the hyperbole and the toxic rhetoric. That s not a short-term project, though. I don t know if there s a magic wand to wave to get us from where we re at, because we ve got a president who openly demonstrates contempt for the press, a First Amendment–protected institution. Openly says he s going to ban people based on their religion.He is openly proposing things that strike at our Constitution.I can t tell you we re going to be fine.People of integrity, your country needs you.That s for both sides of the aisle. The most important thing I think I can do at the DNC is not contribute to the toxicity, but at the same time not back down from a fight.I m not going to name-call like him. I m not going to name - call his supporters either, except for certain of them like the openly racist ones, like David Duke and people like that.The main body of their supporters don t subscribe to those beliefs. In fact, we re trying to help the main body of his supporters. Ezra Klein How do you think about understanding the folks on the other side from you ? Who do you make a point of reading regularly whose ideas you don t agree with? Keith Ellison I read Dick Armey s book Give Us Liberty. I thought that was an interesting book because he describes the rise of the Tea Party. I try and read a mixture of people I agree with and people I don t necessarily agree with.I m reading Terry McAuliffe s book What a Party.He used to be the DNC chair, so I m reading his biography. I think that s interesting.There s a book called Strangers in Their Own Land that I just got through reading. It s about white working class.I read J.D.Vance s book Hillbilly Elegy, just got through that. Thought that was a great book. Ezra Klein What did you take away from Hillbilly Elegy ? Keith Ellison That there are a whole lot of people who are differentiated primarily by race but who share the same economic circumstances all over the country.That there s a general misunderstanding as to why that is and what to do about it. I know J.D. Vance is probably a conservative, but the book he wrote, he makes me wonder why, because Social Security helped keep his family together. If we had a more robust housing policy that could ve helped his mom, if we had more mental health resources and chemical help, that could ve helped his family. He does add in personal responsibility as an issue, but even then, I think that government could help people maintain personal responsibility and help people. This was my take on it. Ezra Klein In his book, though, he expresses deep frustration with the decisions people made.He talked about working at a good, straightforward job with decent pay and watching co - workers simply not show up.So to this question of why is he a conservative, I think that part of his view is that you shouldn t be able to do that, that you shouldn t be rewarded for that, that there shouldn t be something that catches you too much if you just refuse to take the job. What did you think of that argument? Keith Ellison I thought he was using an individual to try to make an argument for a society.Honestly, I think most people do go to work.I think most people do work hard.Of course, you ve got people who are irresponsible and don t take the opportunities that are given to them.Is that most people ? Absolutely not. For example, in Florida, I think the governor said he was going to drug - test everybody on welfare.His wife apparently owned the company that offered the testing kits for these drug tests.Then after thousands and thousands and thousands of people were tested, they came up with three people who tested positive.Three.Not even a full handful of fingers.You ll spend more money looking for welfare fraud than you will find in money of welfare fraud. There s myths in our society, and we re ready to believe them because everybody wants to believe they re more moral, more right, more good than somebody else. What we have to do is say, You know what? People really are good. Republicans start out with saying, People are bad, and when people do bad things, that s just them being how they are. Ezra Klein Do you really think Republicans see it that way ? If you ask Paul Ryan, do you think Paul Ryan would say he thinks people are fundamentally bad ? Keith Ellison I don t know if Paul Ryan would say that or not. I can tell you Paul Ryan is very a mannered person and interpersonally is respectful to people who he encounters, whether they re Democrats or Republicans.What is his core ? He says that he believes the writings of Ayn Rand.What does she believe ? She believes that you got to look out for yourself, that charity is for suckers and the highest good is to please yourself.If he really believes what he says he believes, I would say, yeah.If I asked him, he may not put it that way. It s expensive to be poor Ezra Klein I found out something I didn t know about you. You re a podcaster. Keith Ellison I am a podcaster.I m on We the Podcast. You can get it on iTunes. We have many episodes, but the focal point of the podcast is how the people outside of the millionaire and billionaire class experience the economy. We ve done stuff on the diaper need— Ezra Klein What is the diaper need ? Keith Ellison The Women, Infants, and Children[nutrition program] and regular welfare programs tend not to cover diapers.A small family that has infant children, who s facing some tough times and needs some extra help, they can get food, and they may be able to get health care and housing assistance, but diapers, which can be very expensive, are not included in that benefit. As a result, now you have babies in diapers longer than they should be. You have rashes. You have illness. You have kids staying home. You have parents having to take off work. As a result, there have been folks who have pulled together diaper banks, but they can t meet the overall need. This is not just folks who stay at home all the time. These are working parents. Some of them are in school. They re the working poor.They re making eight bucks an hour. They re making 10 bucks an hour.On top of that, they got to afford diapers, which are pretty expensive.Middle - class people pay less for diapers because they can buy them in greater bulk. Ezra Klein That s one of the realizations I think you have when you start to study poverty, that it s very expensive to be poor.The loans you get cost more.The food you buy costs more, at least for the same item.There are a lot of ways if you have time and you have resources and you have market power that you re just able to get better deals in the economy. If you re poor and you don t have a lot of money, you get screwed on that level. Keith Ellison So true.We the Podcast explores that.We went into how housing prices in Milwaukee in the worst part of town are not appreciably lower than in other parts of town where housing quality is way better.In one episode, we talked to the author of the book Evicted, to talk about the high cost of rent nowadays, particularly in urban centers but also in rural areas. We ve talked about manufactured housing, what some folks call trailers, and talk about this really promising new development where some folks are buying the property that they live on so that they can control it. Most trailer parks, you might own the trailer, but you don t own the land you live on.That can be pretty expensive and can be pretty low quality, and people can get trapped.We go into all that stuff. We also go into the voting gap.Leave aside who donates money, leave aside all that.Upper - income people vote in higher percentages than lower - income people.That is part of the reason why the electorate is a little more conservative than the population. Ezra Klein I want to hold there for a minute.I listened to a bunch of these episodes[and] the voting gap is a recurrent theme.You had a podcast about[Joe Soss s research] showing that folks who are on programs like TANF, which people think of as welfare, don t vote in higher numbers, which is what people might think. Instead, what he finds is that if you feel like the object of a government, if you re acted upon by the government through programs that humiliate you with drug testing and other things, you re more likely to withdraw from the system.And so part of creating participation, particularly among poorer Americans who rely on government services, is for those interactions with the government to be respectful in a way that they often are not.I m curious what you took away from that around program design and about what that moment of interaction between the people the government serves and the programs they use feels like. Keith Ellison Absolutely.Americans of all economic strata benefit from some kind of a government program, but people have a tendency to associate tax cuts and deductions not with the government helping them, if you understand what I mean. Ezra Klein Right, so if you get the mortgage interest deduction, that s money that s yours. You got it back; it s not a government program helping you out. Keith Ellison That s exactly right. Even if you went to the EITC [earned income tax credit], a lot of people, one, don t take advantage of it, but even for the folks who do, there s just this idea that the government s not helping you.They re just giving you back your own money. The truth is that based on the tax code, that s actually the government s money that we re allowing you to keep. People don t think the government does much for them, although the government does a whole lot for them. The result is that anti-government rhetoric can come out of the same person who is the beneficiary of tremendous government largesse. That s part of what I think the Democratic Party has to do, is really help people understand how much the government really does help them.I think we could do a whole lot more in terms of public education on that score. Ellison s favorite books Ezra Klein I asked you about books from people you don t agree with, but what are your three favorite books? Keith Ellison I think the book that probably impacted me the most is a book I read years and years and years ago.It s called Manchild in the Promised Land, by, I think, Claude Brown. I don t know if it s my favorite book, but it was one of the most impactful on me. The Autobiography of Malcolm X I think is just fundamental, irreplaceable. Everybody should read it. I think it s one of great American letters.I really love this book The Warmth of Other Suns.I ve read it many times. It s about probably one of the world s great internal migrations. It talks about how people who had a lot of problems in the South being black under segregation did everything they could to improve the quality of their lives by moving North, by moving West, and outlined their struggles. Reading s one of the great joys of living, so you let me know how many more you want me to talk about. Ezra Klein As many more as you d like. Why don t you give us one more and then I ll let you go, because I do know you re pressed on time. Keith Ellison There s one book that I would really, really, really recommend that everybody get their hands on, and that s Matthew Desmond s book Evicted. This is an important book about housing and the rental crisis we re in , which makes it particularly disturbing that Donald Trump has nominated Ben Carson to be head of HUD.If ever we needed an awesome HUD secretary, it s right now. What we got is somebody who doesn t know the first thing, and that s really sad. One of the points that Matthew Desmond makes in the book Evicted, he said, Look, rent eats first. Rent eats before diapers. Rent eats before food. What gets paid first is rent, because people got to have somewhere to live.The rent gets paid first.I think even if you re conservative or if you re progressive, no matter who you are, if we really tried to attack poverty by going at housing first, we could do tremendous good in improving the lives of a whole lot of Americans. Also there s a book by Frank Luntz. I like reading his stuff. He s an interesting guy.I can t figure out which one to pick out now, but he s a conservative.Borrow his book at the library.I m not trying to get anybody to buy his book. But particularly if you re progressive and you want to understand how conservatives think, it s a good idea to read him. Ari Berman wrote a book recently, Give Us the Ballot.If you believe we re a representative democracy and the vote is essential to what it means to be in America, Ari Berman s book will be good reading.Those are some ones that I ve read, and that I ve read either in the beginning of my adult life or some that I ve read even just more recently. Of course, I read trash too. I read all the books that Dan Brown wrote; I ve read them all.I like them.They re fun. ",

You sent in great questions, and I answered as many as I could. To keep me honest — and to make sure I didn t just talk to myself for two hours — I invited friend-of-the-show Grant Gordon back to the program to help out. We covered a lot of ground. Topics included:- Immortality - The best concerts I ve been to- Why I think culture is the biggest impediment to a universal basic income- Three lessons this podcast has taught me- Three lessons the 2016 election taught me- Three lessons running Vox has taught me- Why my interview questions are so annoyingly long and rambling- How explanatory reporting differs from other kinds of reporting- The best advice I ve been given about interviewing- My favorite books- Why the idea that this reality is a computer simulation reflects a failure of imaginationAnd much, much more. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions, and apologies for all the ones we didn t get to. This was a lot of fun. We ll definitely do it again soon. ",

You can listen to the full discussion on iTunes, on Spotify, on Soundcloud, or anywhere else fine podcasts are found(and, hey, subscribe to The Ezra Klein Show while you re there for more discussions like this one).What follows here are excerpts from our conversation, edited for length and clarity. Ezra Klein If I can read into this ongoing debate you ve had with President Obama, you re arguing that there are some things in American politics and American life that may be counterproductive to believe even if they are true. There is an upbeat story about racial progress and unity that is not only more pleasurable to believe but is more effective to believe if you want to, say, elect an African - American president. And then there s a[more pessimistic] story that is better at predicting day - to - day events, at least right now.But it s a story that nobody wants to hear.To me, the last year or two has been a collision of these two visions— and I think it s the central tension of the piece you ve written. There s something about seeing America s best racial instincts followed by its worst racial instincts in this way.It s very hard to keep both stories, and both countries, in your mind at the same time.So where are you, emotionally and intellectually, after struggling through this article ? Ta - Nehisi Coates I m a big believer in chaos.The history of this country did not necessitate a Donald Trump following a Barack Obama.But it did lay the conditions for it to be possible.You can t be surprised that it happened. I find it hard to say that Obama s optimism was wrong' in a global or moral way.But at the same time— and I think this is what you re teasing out— I don t think someone who looks at race and racism the way I do, or has had the experiences I ve had, could ever be president of the United States.Or would even think to do that. And, look, religion did not come up in our conversations[with Obama].But I think religion undergirds a lot of this.This sort of idea that, At the end of the day, it all works out.'Or maybe, to put it less condescendingly, that, We re on the right side of history, and the arc of the moral universe bends to justice.'That s just something I don t share.The sense of destiny that it will, 'I just don t share it.There s ample evidence it might not.That s where I come down. I don t think you have to believe America is chained to its past and is necessarily doomed to reenact it.But when you study civilizations, it tends to be true that history has a weight, a gravity— if you re going to go in an opposite direction, you need to consciously exercise an opposite force.And I don t see us doing that. Ezra Klein There s already a tremendous pull to say, America is going to be okay.'I see it in a lot of viral columns and articles; I feel it myself: the sense that America has institutions and we ve absorbed worse than this before and everyone is just being hysterical. But America can be okay without Americans being okay.When you re talking about the time frame of the most powerful country in the world, things will probably keep grinding forward.But when you go to the nation - state time scale, you erase the people who will lose their health insurance, or see their parents deported, or get sent to a war that shouldn t have happened. America can be okay in the 50 - year view with a lot of people suffering in the meantime.Obama says this a lot— I think he says this in your piece— that even though the arc of history bends toward justice, it can still zig and zag and go backward.But when I hear that, it can sound a bit like a fast - forward button: Those zags can be real bad. Ta - Nehisi Coates It s very convenient to see progress from slavery to abolition finishing up in the civil rights movement and then a black president. But you have to look at the time between abolition and the civil rights movement: a concerted, white supremacist domestic terror campaign.A 100 - year shadow war waged against individuals.And that was the basis on which democracy was maintained for a big section of the country. How do you overlook that ? Every time I hear the invocation of the New Deal, and people wanting to go back to that, I can t help but hear the basis on which that government was established— the solid South.People who I ve profiled, in my own journalism, were told to be quiet or be killed, they saw their relatives killed. You can t wipe that away.The people in that period didn t ask to be foot stones in your road.From an atheist perspective, life is precious— whenever someone dies, it s the end of their personal universe.The idea we should hand - wave away the deaths that I believe will come as a result of this election— I just can t do it. Ezra Klein I want to go back to something we talked about a few minutes ago— that someone with your ideas couldn t win the presidency.This is, I think, the central argument of your piece: that Obama has a unique background and perspective on racial progress, that is maybe not the norm, maybe not even correct, but was intrinsic to him becoming president. But something I was thinking about reading your piece— and I think you actually say something similar to this— is that by the same token by which you couldn t have someone run for office with your ideas who is an African American, the fact that you could have someone run for office with Donald Trump s is really telling. Barack Obama could never have run on the slogan Make America Great, Finally.'Michelle Obama said in 2008 that it was the first time she was proud of her country, and that was treated as a gaffe; it had to be disavowed.Then Donald Trump literally ran for president arguing he had lost a certain pride in his country.The idea that a black man or woman could have run for office with Donald Trump s personal history as a husband, as a human, is, to me, the most telling piece of this. There is a way in which Obama had to be the best among us.And I mean that putting aside his policies.I ve just always found him to be an admirable human being, even when I disagree with him.And Donald Trump has not had to be the best among us to win this. Ta - Nehisi Coates There are people who say racism wasn t a factor here because there are people who voted for Obama who then voted for Trump.But Obama had to be Obama to get those voters.There is no black equivalent of Trump that is contending for the presidency. David Brooks wrote this column about how we don t know how racism played into this.He said, if you re working - class and you re white and you live in those areas, maybe you d take a chance on Donald Trump; it doesn t mean you endorse all of his ideas. As my buddy said, is that what you said to the followers of Louis Farrakhan ? No, nobody says that to the followers of Louis Farrakhan.No, they blasted him as an anti - Semite, which he is, and say how can people follow this bigoted message. That s the ultimate testament— that you could be Donald Trump and be president.There is no black person who could have the kind of vices Donald Trump and, hell, be governor.Maybe you could be mayor somewhere. Coates s debate with Obama on reparations President Obama Signs 21 st Century Cures Act Photo by Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Ezra Klein In the piece, you talk about a discussion you had with the president on reparations.And he gives this very nuanced answer, where he says, look, when I talk to Malia and Sasha, I say, Yeah, we have responsibility for things we didn t do wrong.'But that s not going to sell politically. To quote what you wrote in your piece, I found it interesting that(Obama s) optimism does not extend to the possibility of the public s accepting wisdoms— such as the moral logic of reparations— that the president, by his own account, has accepted for himself and is willing to teach his children.' One question I have for you after these conversations with Obama is whether you think there s a double argument there— do you think his public view on these issues is different from his private view ? Ta - Nehisi Coates I think there s a contradiction.Why are you optimistic about the boundless ability of the American people to endure Trump but not optimistic about their ability to see politics in a more sophisticated fashion ? Why are you not optimistic about the ability of everyday Americans to accept the wisdom you d teach to your kids ? At that point, [Obama] wasn t being abstract— he was saying, We are responsible for our history, that there s a weight of history, and that we re responsible to that.'And he d teach his kids that. In his defense— he cited various examples across history and said, It s not clear to me this[reparations] works.'That, to me, is contradictory to what I see as him seeing: something special about America.I m hesitating using American exceptionalism, 'because he s pushed back against that a bit.But he sees something at least peculiar and particular about being American. Extending that logic out, if this is the first truly enlightened republic— the oldest democracy in the world— if you are that pioneering, how can you cite other countries that don t have that sort of record ? Where is your exceptionalism now ? Ezra Klein After talking to Obama for four hours, what did you learn about the president that you didn t know otherwise ? Ta - Nehisi Coates He s really smart.He s really smart.And I guess I knew that, but what is said about him often is that he s professorial.But that gives you this picture of a guy giving a lecture.My perception was that he was literally thinking it out as he was talking— that he didn t have canned, prepared answers.I was shocked by how much he wanted to talk about these things.People say the president runs away from these issues, but I don t think that s true. I think he finds the specific situation of black people in this country to be of great intrigue and interest.He s not putting it on— that speech in 2008 about race, he wanted to make that speech.What really surprised me was that he wanted to talk about this stuff with me. Ezra Klein Oh, I wasn t at all.I think you re underplaying your role in this discussion.There has been a conversation that had to be engaged during the Obama administration about race in this country.And he s been one of the people driving this discussion.And you have emerged as one of the key others. Having been there for some of these discussions, I think your critique stings him, and he s someone who responds to criticism.And it s my impression that the criticism he hates, the stuff he really feels— you saw this when he used to attack the professional left'— is that he s frustrated by attacks from people who he feels he s on their side but that they are not taking seriously the drawbacks of their own position or what they d do if they were in his chair. Ta - Nehisi Coates That s true.It came up not with me but with activists— I think in his eye he sees himself as, in some senses, among them.Running the gamut from drone strikes to LGBT issues to Black Lives Matter. At one point in the interview, he said, What, you think I don t care about black people or gay people ? Or because I don t want to do it ? 'I think he thinks he deserves more of a leash than he gets. And this is why I give him all the credit in the world : because he ll do that, and then he ll pull back and say, It s good they re doing it.'He does feel that they should recognize he s on their side, and they should recognize that, but if they stop doing it we might begin to go easy on ourselves. Ezra Klein It s funny what you said a minute ago, that he thinks of himself as part of the activist tradition.Because I hear that and I think, of course he is.Donald Trump is an activist; Bill Clinton was an activist.I recognize that these lines get blurry.I recognize that at some point you change categories.But if you are somebody who has gotten into politics to make dramatic change, and you eventually become president, not only would you see yourself as an activist, you would see yourself as the best damn activist in the country! It s so easy to forget these people are people, and they see themselves in the context of their own story, the story they ve been telling themselves for years.Obama comes to office in the context of George W.Bush.And it s only a year later where you get very serious criticism of him from the left.And I think he s sitting there, saying to himself, you let this guy get elected, and now you re telling me I m not a liberal because I had to bargain away the public option to pass health insurance for 20 or 30 million people ? I m not saying he s right.But I ve always thought it s important to understanding him, and a lot of folks in power.We look at them as the state, and it is hard for them to see themselves as the state. Coates: I m the guy, I guess, who white people read to show they know something' Ezra Klein Something I think you re good at, as a writer— something I routinely make personal vows to be better at and then fail— is communicating your own uncertainty. Ta - Nehisi Coates But that s gotten harder to do . Ezra Klein Why ? Ta - Nehisi Coates Because nobody wants to hear it.I used to blog, as you used to blog.And blogging, as a form, is open to this real - time, ongoing learning process.That went away.But in addition to that, as your profile rises, people say you must have this high profile because you know, because you re an authority. I didn t write too much during this election cycle.One of the reasons I didn t is because I didn t want to play this oracular role.There was no space to figure it out, to think about it, or go through the arguments if you re writing.If you re writing something critical about[Bernie] Sanders, then you necessarily want Hillary Clinton— that s the only lens through which it s interpreted. There s no room to tease out, say, in my case specifically, what it means that the representative of the left tradition in the Democratic Party rejects reparations.No room to tease out what that means.But then what am I doing ? I m just making pronouncements.I ve become, in the most vulgar sense, a pundit.I m not open to having my mind changed, I m not trying to figure it out; I m not out here curious and exploring.I am standing on a rock, sitting on a throne, making pronouncements about what the world is.And that is so boring.It bores me to tears. This piece, I had a ball doing it, because to the extent that my opinions are in the piece, they re pulled way back.This is the Obama show.It was this opportunity to pick up the pad and the recorder and just learn, to get out of the way and just learn.Okay, I disagree with you, but how did you come to that ? That s still a question I m interested in answering. A few months ago, somebody got upset because Between the World and Me had no citations of women in the book.In fact, there s only one citation in the book, and it s of a woman who is a historian at Duke!But it didn t matter whether that was true or not, because you re a signpost of something.You become a symbol. And that has kind of happened to me in my career.And I don t know what to do about that.I m the guy who, I guess, white people read to show they know something.And that s what Between the World and Me is now.It s used as a symbol for something— what do you do when that s the case ? That s not what you write for. How do you get back to learning and exploring when you get success ? Ezra Klein How do you feel about that with Between the World and Me ? Ta - Nehisi Coates It s disturbing. Ezra Klein Did you expect that from the book ? Ta - Nehisi Coates No, no, no.First of all, I didn t expect the book to be so successful.I just didn t.Writers have to prepare themselves to not be read by a bunch of people.I had all my defenses up for that.I had no defenses for the idea that the biggest question about The World and Me would not be about my friend Prince Jones, who got killed; not about the communication between myself and my son; not about growing up in West Baltimore; but, why are so many white people reading this book ? Literally whole articles written about what is going on here. You feel yourself trying to write from an African - American perspective that is not fully represented, and in your mind, to the extent there is any audience, you see yourself as writing for African - Americans who are like you, who are somewhat frustrated about things— the book is for them, in that sense, it s for that feeling.It s not that you don t want other people to read it, but then the entire book becomes like that, about what white people think about it.Even as you try to write away from it. I saw this SNL skit a couple weeks back called The Bubble, 'where you could retreat from Trump.And a signature of the bubble was a young white woman reading Between the World and Me.And that s what it means to be in the bubble. The black people in Harlem, in West Baltimore, in the South Side of Chicago, and in Washington, DC, who inspired that book, who empowered that book— they re erased.They have no meaning for the interpretation of the book, and what matters is white people reading the book.I m not sure how to make sense out of that. Ezra Klein It s interesting, someone from the outside may look at you and that book and say, He s attained so much power.' Ta - Nehisi Coates But that s not what it was for ! Ezra Klein But I hear you saying is that you ve also lost control of it. Ta - Nehisi Coates That s right— it was never for that.We are creeping in on, like, a million books, a ridiculous number.I didn t write the book thinking about that. My friend got killed, and I was deeply angry about that for a long time.I had an encounter with an African - American president that I was thinking about.I read James Baldwin and wanted to express something.But power ? Nah. I m getting personal now, but I m 41 and have a 16 - year - old kid and a wife I ve been with for 18 years.What would I do with that power ? What am I supposed to do with that ? I m not going to get out of the town and get drunk, or hold out copies of Between the World and Me and hit on 20 - year - old women.What tangible thing is supposed to come from that power ? I don t sit on boards and control who gets access to what; that s not who I am. For the rest of the discussion— and there s much, much more— subscribe to The Ezra Klein Show podcast.",

Our first discussion focused on race, class, populism, and the sometimes toxic ways the three interact. It's a topic I wanted to revisit in the aftermath of Trump's election, and so I asked Heather back to the show. After this conversation, I'm very, very glad I did. Among other things, we discussed:-The three factors that explain the election results-Why race is a more complex force in politics than either liberals or conservatives assume-The dangers of Democrats convincing themselves that populism and racial justice are either/or-Her experience talking with a white man who realized he was prejudiced, and asked her help in changing-Why Clinton lost states Obama won-Why Clinton didn't outperform Obama among nonwhite voters-Why the core of modern racism is seeing some races as made of individuals and others as collectives-Whether the very language around race and racism makes empathy more difficult-How Democrats should think about cooperating — and not cooperating — with TrumpAnd, as always, much more. Heather is brilliant on these topics, and this is worth listening to.Also, a lot of you have asked for an episode where I answer your questions, and we're going to make it happen.",

Also on McGhee s nighststand: Tamara Draut s Sleeping Giant, which argues that the new working class is more diverse and female than ever before, and Octavia s Brood, an African-American fantasy and sci-fi series.

And why was the polling so completely wrong?No one digs deeper into the demographics, polls, and trends of modern American politics than the Atlantic's Ron Brownstein. Though he didn't predict Trump's win, his pre-election writing explained exactly how it could — and eventually did — happen. And it's a more complicated story than you've heard.In the week since the election, much has been made of Trump's strength among white working class voters — and properly so, as they were core to his victory. But the white working class wasn't the primary cause of Clinton's loss. Her real problem were groups that didn't turn out for her in the numbers her campaign expected — college-educated whites, African-Americans, and millennials. And that suggests a very different future for the Democrats. In this conversation, Brownstein goes through the math of the election in detail. We also talk about:-What Clinton s campaign assumed, wrongly, about winning the middle of the country.-The two quotes that Brownstein thinks explain the entire election-How much James Comey influenced the election s outcome-Why Trump was able to win the support of voters who thought him unqualified-What might have happened if Democrats had chosen Bernie Sanders as their nominee.-Whether the next Democratic nominee should be focused on winning back working-class whites or energizing the Obama coalition-The worrying signs the Republican Party will see if it compares Trump's win to Reagan's wins-Why Brownstein sees Trump as a political independent candidate who happened to run under the Republican banner (and why Ezra disagrees)-What will be hard and easy for a Trump administration to do while working with a Republican Congress.And much more. There's a lot of confusion about this election. Brownstein is here to clear it up. ",

And we wanted to talk about it. The 2016 election is the product of profound failures on the part of different institutions in American life: the Republican Party, the media, the financial system. And few have tracked those failures as clearly, or closely, as David Frum.Frum is Canadian by birth — a perspective, he says, that helps him see American politics as the product of institutions, rather than just personalities. Since moving to the US in the 80s and finding himself inspired by Ronald Reagan, he's chronicled and commentated on conservatism in America. His book, Dead Right, is one of the key documents for understanding the Republican Party of the 1990s. He then did a stint as speechwriter in George W. Bush's White House, where he wrote the famous Axis of Evil line in Bush's 2002 State of the Union. More recently, he's written for the Atlantic, where he's been unsparing — and largely proven right — in his assessment of the Republican Party's institutional collapse.This conversation is an exploration of what has happened to the Republican Party — what it was, what it's become, and why. We talk about:-Why journalists need to account for governing institutions before turning to cultural explanations-How he thinks diversity and inequality are linked-How Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump differ-What he learned about inequality while working for the Wall Street Journal editorial page-The best-titled speech Newt Gingrich probably ever gave-His critique of the 1994 Republican Revolution and Newt Gingrich s consolidation of the Speaker s power-How Fox News and conservative talk radio echo chamber have harmed the Republican Party-The apocalyptic attitude conservatives rely on while campaigning -Why Trump was so successful running against the Bush family legacy-The role white nationalism plays in Trump's rise (This is an argument I found particularly valuable)-How Canada avoided the nationalist backlash that plagues the US-His best and worst-case scenarios for a Hillary Clinton presidency  And then go vote.",

David Frum: former George W.Bush speechwriter, columnist at The Atlantic Atlantic writer David Frum. Frum began by choosing Joseph Schumpeter s Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, a 1942 book on economics, sociology and political theory that explored the limits of Marxian theory and predicted that late capitalism would slide toward social democratic states. Skip the socialism and capitalism chapters, read the democracy chapters, Frum says. Frum also highlighted the books on World War I and World War II of Yale historian Adam Tooze: The overwhelming message is that the central fact of the 20 th Century is that the world system could no longer work unless run by the United States, and when America absented itself the world spun out of control. Only American intervention brought us a stable world system. Lastly, Frum recommended a book called The Great Divergence, by University of Chicago historian Kenneth Pomeranz, which explores why the European economic system took off in the Industrial Era and the Chinese economy did not.",

Her book You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversation, was on the New York Times best seller list for nearly four years, including eight months as number one. But I got to know her earlier this year, as part of a reporting project to understand Hillary Clinton's leadership style, and the ways in which it's lost — and even a liability — on the campaign trail.Tannen's work has helped me understand not just Clinton and Trump's communication styles, but my own — her analysis of how men and women communication at home, and in the workplace, is useful no matter who you are. This episode, more than any other I've done, is full of practical insight into situations we all face daily. Among our topics:-How she became a linguist-Why everyone in her doctoral program was recording the conversations at dinner parties-The ways in which linguistics can solve the same problems as psychology-How cultural attitudes about interruptions and silence lead to miscommunication and frustration (I found this one *very* relevant)-The debate over African-American Vernacular English, and the crucial research that both powered it, and has been forgotten about it -The components of what she calls  conversational style   and how they vary depending on who you are-How gender roles can create conflict within relationships, even just in end-of-the-day check-ins with your partner-Why women are perceived to speak more than men, even when they're speaking less-How gendered forms of communication have changed perceptions of Hillary Clinton-Why she tries to never use the word sexism when discussing evaluations of Clinton and other female politicians-How expectations of good leadership are caught up in gendered ideas of what leaders look and sound likeAnd so, so much more.

Is this just a bad year ? Or, in the context of decades of falling faith in government, frequent government shutdowns and near - debt crises, and a fracturing Republican Party, is something deeper and more dangerous afoot ? On a recent episode of The Ezra Klein Show, I posed this question to political scientist Francis Fukuyama, whose recent books on the development and decay of liberal democracies offers a much broader perspective on whether America s political system is genuinely imperiled. Fukuyama s answer wasn t particularly comforting. We are going through one of the most severe political crises I have experienced in my lifetime, 'he said. Gulp. You can listen to our full conversation— and subscribe to The Ezra Klein Show— here.Excerpts of our discussion, edited for length and clarity, follow. America, a vetocracy' Ezra Klein I d like to get a sense of where you see American politics right now.You have this wonderful framing device in your book Political Origins, in which you say countries are in some ways trying to get to a stable, liberal democracy like Denmark. Right now, do you think America is in the Denmark category ? Francis Fukuyama The other big political theme in my book is political decay. So countries move toward Denmark, but they never quite get there— I don t think even Denmark is quite the Denmark of the popular imagination.But they can move backward, and we are going through one of the most severe political crises I have experienced in my lifetime. You have a candidate who could undo a lot of the institutional rules we ve come to accept for American politics.The Trump candidacy represents the forgotten white working class that has been underrepresented in American democracy over the past generation.So they re getting a voice— it s the correct working of democracy.But it s very unlikely to result in changes that will fix any of the underlying problems that make people upset. Ezra Klein What do you think Trump represents in terms of those basic foundations about the construction of institutions, from the 30, 000 - foot level ? We re caught up in talking about Trump as an individual too often. Francis Fukuyama I coined a phrase in the book— vetocracy, 'meaning rule by veto.'And the broader argument is that the American political system has always made it very hard for the government to actually do things because it gives a lot of parts of the political system veto rights over what the system does. In most of the 20 th century this was not a terrible system, because there was a lot of overlap between the major political parties.And so all of the major pieces of legislation— the Great Society, the Reagan tax cuts— were based on cooperation between Republicans and Democrats.But a lot has changed, including the partisan polarization in Congress and in the broader society, as well as the rise of interest groups. I think the political decay comes in when those interest groups really use their power to veto things not in their interest.This carried interest provision— which allows hedge fund managers to be taxed only at 15 percent where everyone else has to pay closer to 40 percent...nobody justifies this except a very small group of people, politically, but we can t get rid of it because that group is well - funded enough to veto the kind of legislation we d need to change the law. People perceive this on the left and the right.The Trump supporters and the Sanders supporters don t like hedge fund managers and the oligarchs that populate American politics and are struggling to solve the problem. Ezra Klein Would you have said three or four years ago that the American political system is as vulnerable as you might say it is today ? Francis Fukuyama No, I wouldn t have. We went through a period like this in the 1930 s after the Great Depression where you had a lot of economic distress and a lot of radical policies being pursued, and Germany and Italy went off in this authoritarian direction and the United States chose Franklin Roosevelt— a radical in the context of American politics, but[he] stayed well within the political frame. I think people thought that just reflected a very different kind of American political culture that is deeply democratic and liberal.I think this election year has suggested that maybe we were just lucky back then and there was nothing deeply constraining that kind of move other than just good leadership. Ezra Klein What countries in the world do you think are governed best ? Francis Fukuyama I think a lot of the Commonwealth countries— Australia, New Zealand, Canada.Countries like Germany, Denmark— the Scandinavian countries.They re not polarized in any way like we are here.They ve enacted pretty difficult, let s say, labor market reforms that caused anguish and internal controversy, but they did it and have better policies as a result. I don t think there s a general problem to democratic governance, but you can see the threat to them all around the margins.Because I think some of those successful countries, especially the Scandinavian ones, are pretty small and pretty homogeneous. Why Fukuyama thinks class is the right way to talk about Trump voters Trump (Ralph Freso / Getty Images) Ezra Klein I think there s been a tendency in the conversation to sanitize the forces powering Trump.It s very comfortable for cosmopolitan political elites to say, The white working class is economically struggling, and if we just put into effect my economic opinions, there d be no problem. People are very comfortable arguing about trade policy or taxes or mills closing.But if you are going to take Trump voters concerns seriously, it seems to me you have to take seriously that very real skepticism against where the country is headed demographically— and that includes things like letting Muslims and Mexican immigrants in . Francis Fukuyama Well, it depends on how you interpret what you just said. You didn t use the words racism, ' bigotry, ' prejudice, 'but that seems to me part of the argument you re making— that this is driven by bad motives and not just the reasonable reactions of working - class people to losing their jobs and livelihoods. Ezra Klein I appreciate that you notice I didn t use those words! It seems to me we need to have space in the conversation for something that is not quite racism but is clearly an anxiety around demographic change.I think a lot of people are feeling something that s not what we d label as racism' but is a profound concern about their place in society that s tied to race.It s questions of , Where am I in society ? Where are my children going to be in the hierarchy of American power in 10 years ? ' Francis Fukuyama Well, that s fine.I think that s a good, non - pejorative way of putting it.And I think that s a correct analysis of what s happening. We ve seen the Democratic Party become this party of identity politics.It s assembled all these different categories— gays, African Americans, Hispanics.And the one group that was missing was this white working class, where they d all drifted to the Republican Party. If you think about the problem in terms of identity, we have these people who used to be in the dominant culture in the country.And all of a sudden, all these other identity groups appear, and they re getting affirmative action and seem to be getting government policy.And[they] say, What about us ? 'Because being working class has put us at these huge disadvantages, objectively. I think that is the anxiety behind it, and you can t just say, It s racism and bigotry.' Ezra Klein I feel like this conversation might lead a Martian to believe that African Americans have much higher incomes than the white working class.But they don t.There s still a lot of racism and bigotry and sexism in society. We are in this weird moment where the sense of who is privileged and who is empowered is very difficult to disentangle.You have a much broader perspective on how polities deal with this kind of question.So what is a successful way to deal with this ? Francis Fukuyama You don t want to say, Well, we have identity politics, and here s this other group, white people, and they re an identity group, too.And we need to accommodate them as an identity group the way we have for gays, African Americans, and Hispanics.'That s really a big mistake. Even if you don t think this is all being driven by economic distress, I think it s much better to talk about this in class terms rather than identity terms.Class is much more neutral, and, in fact, it is the central divide in American politics today. If you look across African Americans, you ve had a middle class do extremely well over the last generation.And you have an underclass that s been extremely stagnant.Keeping the focus on class is important. In terms of identity, you do not want to validate identity politics in the way that everyone belongs to a victimized list.You want to talk positively about American identity and the shared values it consists of , because that s how you integrate people into a larger cultural whole. That s been done by presidents in the past, but I don t hear most of the candidates doing it in this election. What President Fukuyama would do Ezra Klein Agreeing no parliamentary system is in the offing in America, what are the process reforms that feel like they might be near at hand ? That could actually happen in the next 10 to 15 years ? Francis Fukuyama If the problem is vetocracy, meaning too many veto points, you have an agenda to reduce the veto points. I d start with senatorial holds.It s absurd that any senator can block any presidential appointment that s up for Senate confirmation they want.There s a huge backlog of judges and administrators because of the polarization. I d get rid of the filibuster so you don t need a supermajority to pass routine legislation.I say that with some trepidation, because with a President Trump that d be quite useful. My colleague at Stanford has a new book saying you can shift the powers dramatically to the executive branch, where Congress can no longer propose legislation but can only vote up or down proposed by the executive.I think it s too dramatic a shift, but you could do that for the federal budget.It d go to Congress for an up - or - down vote, or, more realistically given that Americans probably wouldn t approve that, you could do something like that in Congress itself. Ezra Klein Let s say the next president says, I ve read your books on political decay, and I totally agree it s a huge problem.'What do you tell them to do ? Francis Fukuyama You would need to address the problem of campaign finance on the left and right motivating a lot of the anger.If it requires political pressure on the court to require higher regulation of money in politics, that would be part of the agenda. Fundamentally, the inequality problem is also the driver of a lot of the anger.There s two things I think you could do that would have an impact: tax reform that would get rid of our ridiculous tax forms that are full of giveaways for special interests in the country.And then infrastructure— a big investment spree that would have to be accompanied by changes to rules that make it hard to get these changes done in less than 10 years. Between those two things, I think you d address the underlying causes of voter anger.",

Another is that we overestimate the importance of the president national politics and underestimate the important of city officials and local politics.Dr. Leana Wen — and this episode — stands at the intersection of those two ideas.Wen is the Baltimore City Health Commissioner — a job she got when she was only 31, after a stint as an ER doctor, and a background as a Rhodes Scholar and medical activist. Her work in Baltimore coincided with the aftermath of Freddy Gray's killing, a brutal opioid epidemic, and a renewed focus on urban health disparities (there are counties in Baltimore that have higher infant mortality than the West Bank).In this conversation, we talk about all that and more. Here's some of the more:-Why her family moved to Utah after leaving China after the Tiananmen Square protests-Whether America's culture of sharing problems and working through pain is actually healthy-How she learned to deal with a serious speech impediment (and how I did)-What it was like growing up in Compton in the early 90s-How Bill Clinton s autobiography changed her life-What motivated her to become a doctor-How she squares her idea of herself as an activist with being a government official-The unexpected process by which you get a job like Baltimore City Health Commissioner-How the medical community s understanding of pain has changed, and how that led to the opioid crisis-The misunderstandings of outdated ideas that have made the opioid crisis so much worse-Why she prescribed a drug to treat heroin overdoses to everyone — yes, everyone — in Baltimore-Her thoughts on the paradox of Baltimore s great health institutions and its huge health disparities-What disturbs her about the patterns that lead up to infant mortalityI particularly want to call out Wen's discussion of the opioid crisis, and what needs to be done about it. It's one of the clearest and most impassioned tours through that epidemic I've heard, and it's worth listening to this conversation just for that.",

But Gladwell is perhaps the greatest contrarian journalist of his generation — he looks at things you've seen before, comes to conclusions that are often the opposite of the conventional wisdom, and then leaves you wondering how you could ever have missed what he saw. To see something new in something old is a talent, it's a process, and it's what we discuss, in a dozen different ways, in this episode. Among the topics we tackle:-How Gladwell got started at the Washington Post after being fired from another job for waking up late-Gladwell s high school zine based on personal attacks and Bill Buckley-How Canadians are disinclined to escalate conflicts-The value and nature of boredom in childhood-How people reflexively pile on to convenient narratives  -How the economics of media might be influencing its current tone-Why pickup trucks today are so much larger than they used to be-His insights about the current identity of journalists as a culture-Why podcasting is different from writing for the page/screen-Why talking about numbers can be difficult in audio-How the internet will one day seem like an experiment gone completely awry-Why you shouldn t have satellite radio in your car-Whether more individualized education is a a good idea-The importance of people who are above average though not exceptionalThis is a fun conversation, but it's also a useful one. It's hard to look at something that is believed to be understood and realize it's been misunderstood.

This is Gladwell's great skill — it is the product of both a process and an outlook, and it's worth hearing how he does it. If William F.Buckley were a 15 - year - old Canadian in rural Ontario and had a zine, what would he say ? 'says Gladwell, who is now nobody s idea of a Buckley - ite conservative. We had gone to the used bookstores in Toronto and collected every William F.Buckley column and memorized them, and tried reproducing them for our tiny audience.' On the podcast, Klein and Gladwell also discussed why Gladwell believes the internet is a fuck - up, 'why he got fired from the American Spectator, and the big cultural divide between Canada and America.You can listen to the episode here or by subscribing to The Ezra Klein Show on iTunes.) That time a 15 - year - old Malcolm Gladwell tried to imitate William F.Buckley, Canada style Ezra Klein How did you first get involved in journalism ? Malcolm Gladwell I had what was called a zine— wait, are you too young for zines ? Ezra Klein I know about them, but in an abstract way.I m more of the generation that s at the tail end of zines emerging into blogs.But as shocking as it is, some of our listeners may not know what a zine is. Malcolm Gladwell A zine is a homemade magazine— it s what you did if you lived in a small town and had some pretensions to cultural importance.You ran your own magazine and ran it off on a Xerox machine and distributed it to your friends.Lots of people had zines in the 70 s and 80 s. I had a zine called Ad Hominem: A journal of slander and political opinion.And I did it with two people— my two best friends in high school, one of whom is now an opinion editor at the New York Times, and another of whom is a history professor at Harvard University. These are my two best friends in a tiny, little, weird Bible Belt town in Elmira, Ontario— and we did the zine together and wrote opinion pieces.And our rule was you had to attack someone personally.That s why it was called Ad Hominem.My column was called The Moral Pejorative, 'and I would invite people to write things in the understanding that I would denounce them in the moral pejorative.We put out six or seven episodes funded by the older brother of my friend. Ezra Klein So who are you attacking ? Are you attacking Canadian politicians ? Your teachers ? Who is the target of Ad Hominem ? Malcolm Gladwell It was on a very high level. This is 70 s Canada— the high - water mark of Canadian left - wing dominance.So the only way for us to rebel was to be conservative, and so we were all obsessed with William F.Buckley.We wanted to be William F.Buckley.And we were imagining if William F.Buckley was a 15 - year - old Canadian in rural Ontario and had a zine, what would he say ? We had gone to the used bookstores in Toronto and collected every William F.Buckley column and memorized them, and tried reproducing them for our tiny audience.We would write for El Salvador or the Trudeau government or the big issues of the day— that s what we were tackling. Ezra Klein I m always interested in what direction people come to journalism from.Some love the craft of writing.And there are folks who ended up in these policy magazines who were interested in arguing and ideas and pushing them and saw journalism as a kind of activism. It sounds like you began in that last group— is that fair ? Malcolm Gladwell Very much so. The three of us, these friends in high school, were really mischief makers.That was our primary motivation.We engaged in a whole series of actions designed to subvert the school— one was Ad Hominem, but it was a sustained campaign of mischief. We marched on city hall, for example.We had this principal who was a lovely, sweet man whom we all liked— beautifully bland and boring and ordinary, but a wonderful principal.But they transferred him, and to protest his transfer we arranged for the school buses to transport about 400 students 30 miles to the county seat.And we marched half a mile down the main street in Kitchener, Ontario, all carrying huge signs, Hell no, Milken[the principal] won t go.' We were marching against the chair of the Board of Ed, whose name was Wollstonecraft.We had just read King Lear, and so another one of the signs said Wollstonecraft, bloody scepter d tyrant.' It was all just mischief - making.We liked Milken, but we liked the opportunity to like him more than we liked him, you know ? Because it s Canada— and I don t think Americans quite get this— everyone was complicit.There was no opposition; no one got upset or in trouble.We took 300 students out of high school, transported them 30 miles, and had them march on city hall, and there wasn t a single consequence to our actions.Not a one.The teachers thought it was hilarious; Milken was highly amused. We stood with a megaphone under the Board of Education offices.With 300 kids, [my friend] Bruce gave this extraordinarily over - the - top speech, climaxing with, You can run, Wollstonecraft, but you can t hide.' And no one cared, because it s Canada.Because the whole ethos is permissive, in the best way.I can t imagine that would be possible in Westchester County in 2016 at some high school. What s the big cultural divide between America and Canada ? Ezra Klein There s this cut on the US - Canada difference— that Canada is a gentle consensus but Americans are more bullish, more fractious.What do you think is the cultural difference between America and Canada ? Malcolm Gladwell There s something quite fundamental that separates the two cultures— a disinclination to escalate social conflict. It isn t that there isn t social conflict[ in Canada].But I feel that in this country, there s no opportunity for conflict that is missed— you seize on it, and then you turn up the volume. Whereas at least the Canada of my youth was the opposite.You found conflicts and you found a way to push them aside.So if you think about what I just described— taking kids out of school for an afternoon— people looked at that and said, It s kind of great kids like their principal a lot.We could make a big deal out of this, but what would be the point ? ' I tell this story about my brother, an elementary school principal of a little school out in a very religious rural area.And it was the most well - behaved school of all time, where no one ever acted out.He transferred to the most troubled school in the district because he was getting bored and felt he was wasting his time. He said that a lot of the best teachers wanted to be transferred with[him] because the top teachers always want to teach at the toughest school.I think in that profession, and maybe it s broader in that, this is how they define their value.That s really Canadian somehow— the idea that the profession is somehow stamped with this desire. Ezra Klein So why did you end up settling in America ? Malcolm Gladwell I ve been obsessed with America from an early age. I remember going into the library as a teenager and discovering the New York Review of Books— I d never been to New York, and I remember being completely blown away.There was all of this intellectual excitement. I grew up in a farming town in the country, where I was bored my entire childhood.I was desperate for some kind of excitement— drama, conflict, anything.I was bored from the age of 6 to the age of 16. Why Gladwell thinks the modern - day version of the internet will one day be seen as nutty Malcolm Gladwell I think the internet, as it is presently configured, in 25 years or 50 years from now will seem like a very bizarre experiment gone awry.That the idea of building a system fundamentally for every human interaction that is incapable of defending itself is insane.I mean, insane. Ezra Klein What do you mean by defending itself ? Malcolm Gladwell Exhibit No.1 of complete public policy argument: Hillary s emails. People are jumping up and down because Hillary broke a rule and used a private server on her BlackBerry for stuff she could have kept on the State Department server.Meanwhile, the State Department server has been hacked so many times we ve lost count. Two years ago, the State Department server had to be shut down because there was Russian malware on it that they couldn t get rid of .Snowden makes off with all of the diplomatic cables, and then OPM[Office of Personnel Management] gets hacked— every single file of every American who has ever applied for a national security clearance is in the hands of the Chinese.The federal government— the entire cyber apparatus of the federal government— is Swiss cheese. And we re still having an argument about it being on her BlackBerry.If it was on her Blackberry, it d be 100 times safer than on the State Department server.It s the only kind of argument you could have if you re completely out of touch with the monster you ve created.And the monster is indefensible.It can t defend itself— it s built so random people in Bulgaria can drop in at the drop of a hat.Every major institution in this country has been hacked.… How long can this go on ? At a certain point, we re going to say : We need a new internet.The internet is a fuck - up!I don t understand how no one sees this. Here I am, a customer of Citibank.Why hasn t Citibank come to me and said, Malcolm, we are terribly sorry, but there s nothing we can do to defend your finances from being hacked.If you pay us $1, 000 a year, we can put you in a system to reduce your chances of being hacked by 99 percent.' Why hasn t Citibank done this ? Because they re numbskulls.Because they re living with their head in the sand— and so does the State Department, and so does everybody. I get hyper about this because I think it s insanity on every level.We re going to look and say, Jesus, what were we thinking ? ' Ezra Klein One of the things I like about your Citibank example is that I think almost nobody would pay the $1, 000. And the reason I m pretty sure about that is that the lengths people will go to to not change a password is extraordinary. I was hacked recently… and it made me realize how many things I have not taken the time to fortify.I think one of the points of vulnerability is not just that the systems are easy to hack but that we really dislike the work of making them hard to hack— even when we know better. Malcolm Gladwell Yeah, I agree with all of what you said, but I will say that the internet was designed to be open.That s the design flaw, in retrospect.Everything we deal with, with hacking, is not a bug of the internet— it s a feature.And we have to fundamentally redesign it to eventually deal with hacking. Malcolm Gladwell: acclaimed author, New Yorker essayist Malcolm Gladwell first jokingly endorsed a book by his mother, a 1969 memoir. He also extolled Eliot Cohen s Military Misfortunes: The Anatomy of Failure in War, which argues that calamities on the battlefield stem from overly complex systems rather than individual error. It s one big, beautiful allegory about the kinds of high-stakes mistakes decision-makers make, Gladwell says. I love anyone who can write about x and make a much broader point about y. That person is a hero.",

      "description": "Grant Gordon is a political scientist and policymaker who specializes in humanitarian intervention. He s a fellow at the Stanford Center on International Conflict and Negotiation, and has worked on humanitarian and development policy for the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the UN Office of Humanitarian Coordination, the UN Refugee Agency, as well as the Rwandan Government, Open Society Justice Initiative and other organizations. All of that is a long way of saying he works on the some of the world's worst problems and conflicts, and tries to figure out which interventions will actually help.

Talking to Atul was a real pleasure. I hope you enjoy it too. You can get a little dizzy just thinking about how much Atul Gawande gets done every year. Gawande s main job is as a cancer surgeon— he performs around 200 surgeries a year.He s also executive director of a Harvard center dedicated to improving critical care, works with the World Health Organization on running his large - scale experiments, and is the chair of a separate nonprofit that works to reduce surgery deaths globally. Oh, and on top of that ? Gawande finds time to write truly gorgeous, award - winning feature stories for the New Yorker about his surgery and research. Gawande recently appeared on an episode of Vox s The Ezra Klein Show(you can listen to the full discussion by streaming it here or by subscribing to the podcast on iTunes).In the episode, Klein and Gawande discuss Gawande s story about chemical castration for prisoners, his time working in Bill Clinton s White House, and why Gawande thinks ineptitude has overtaken ignorance as medicine s key problem. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.For the full conversation, subscribe to the podcast! Why Gawande thinks ineptitude is now the major challenge to human health Ezra Klein: There s been this theme in a lot of your work which is that human beings often do very basic things more poorly than they realize they do . And one thing I ve taken from your writing is that so much writing about health care is about the margin— the brand new cancer therapy, the brand new medication.And you ve been very focused on the improvements we can get not from tremendous innovations but to be able to apply what we already know more uniformly and rigorously. Where did that outlook come from ? Atul Gawande : To me, failure has been the thing I m most interested in over time.The intersection between failure and suffering.I remember reading an essay when I was doing philosophy on the nature of human fallibility by Samuel Gorovitz and Alasdair MacIntyre. They point out that there are two key reasons people fail at whatever it is they set out to do .One reason is because of ignorance.We just don t know all the laws that apply to the physical universe, and we don t have a complete staid description of the universe that those laws apply to, and therefore we have research and discovery. The second reason we fail is what they called ineptitude.Meaning, the knowledge exists but an individual or group of individuals fails to apply that knowledge correctly.What s really interesting to me about living in our time and in our generation is that that is a remarkable change of living now: that ineptitude is as much or a bigger force in our lives than ignorance. [For] most of human history, we were ignorant about the diseases that affected us— why do our bodies go wrong, and what can we do about it ? What can we do about the world we live in and our environment ? What can we do about many, many things ? We still have huge areas of ignorance— whether it s Alzheimer s disease or some cancers or fundamental aspects about how the economy behaves.But now we know a ton.In health care, we have enumerated the more than 60, 000 ways our 13 organs can go wrong.And for those 60, 000 diseases and conditions we have created more than 6, 000 drugs and more than 4, 000 medical and surgical procedures, and we have an uncounted number— easily in the thousands of ways— to prevent diseases or the occurrence of those disease.Our job is to deploy that capability town by town to every person alive. Now, in your life, the reason we may have suffering is more likely to be because of ineptitude— our inability to deliver on existing knowledge— than it is because of ignorance.And that is incredibly interesting to me.I want to understand how we solve those problems, and I want to understand why we even have that feeling : We apply a word like ineptitude as if it s a moral failure that things can go wrong.And it s actually not that often about an individual s malfeasance. It s about the ways we re all set up for failure under the conditions of complexity.And delivering on that capability may be the most ambitious thing human beings have ever attempted.This is all about trying to deliver on that discovery and capability. And we re about to have a whole separate lump of incredible discovery— whether it s cancer care or something from genomics.So I find it incredibly interesting, curious...but also incredibly important.This is the challenge of our generation and the next couple of generations— how we have systems to realize the benefits of all this discovery we ve had.We re nowhere close to capturing it. EK: I m really interested in this idea that we look at someone who could have done something that could have been done but didn t, and we look at them as failing. We have this idea that competence is not making mistakes and getting everything right.As opposed to: Competence is knowing you will make mistakes and setting up a context that will help reduce the possibility of error but also help deal with the aftermath of error. AG: I am drawn to these really mundane things like hand - washing.It s 2 million people who pick up infections in hospitals and 900, 000 people who die from those infections, and most of them would be prevented if they washed their hands correctly. The fact that we can t and haven t figured out how to solve that...seeing the ways hand - washing becomes incredibly onerous if you re a nurse and have to manage eight patients and have to wash your hands every eight seconds and the bells are going off and they re calling me from the other room. But what if we add Purell ? That cuts time, but then we have to make sure the dispenser is full.What if the dispenser is not full ? And then you add those components along the way, and then to deliver on all this care for these places. Competence requires us not only to be a little forgiving for how difficult it is to be competent but also to recognize that there s no mistake too dumb for us to make.We make a lot of mistakes all the time.There s enormous gains that come from just reducing some of these mistakes enough to knock it down 10 or 15 percent. The third part of this is entering a culture that can be forgiving about mistakes.If we expect perfection from our politicians— if we expect them to take no chances, no risks, and make incredibly complex things happen in the world— we can always find where things go wrong.And the real measure is if things are getting better. How Gawande came to combine surgery, public health, and politics EK: One of the reasons I admire you is that you seem to have integrated a set of skills in your life in a way that I can t think of anyone else having done. You work as a surgeon, and you see things that are wrong or you learn things that are encouraging.Then you take the things that your work in clinical settings alerts you to, and you create beautiful essays and books and reports on them.And then you take the work you do inthose essays books and reports, and you try to find an answer to the question that you asked by turning them into large - scale experiments that actually change the way people practice medicine. When did you begin to see these things as not separate, but as actually all one pursuit ? Or do you not see them that way ? AG : I do see them as part of one thing, but it took a long time for me to figure out how it all fit together. I came out of college— I m the son of two Indian doctors— so what are you supposed to become ? Another Indian doctor.And I was very resistant to that. That s not who I wanted to be.I worked in politics for a while— way back in college, I worked for the Gary Hart campaign until it ended....In 92, I worked for [Bill] Clinton and ended up being his health care and social policy adviser.I d tried rock music, that didn t work very well.I tried being a philosopher; I got a master s in politics and philosophy and found out that I had a hard time understanding the questions, let alone offering original answers... I learned that I didn t love having my future controlled by the fates of politicians.So I decided to go back and do what my parents always knew I would do— go to medical school.Along the way, I was trying to figure out how I could feed the part of me that cared about policy and cared about how we make a difference in people s lives on a large scale, while I was working on improving people s lives on a very small scale. EK: So you decide that politics isn t for you.Then what ? AG : Well, yes, working for politicians wasn t for me.I still loved policy, and I still love how we move ideas. I went back to medical school because I felt like I needed to have my own experience in the world and have my own kind of relevance and skill set that you couldn t take away.Medicine turned out to be fantastic.Having grown up with parents who were two doctors in a small town, there was just a familiarity to it. But the second part was you re deeply inside people s lives.And you feel the complexity of how all these forces in the world— from economics to social forces in people s lives to science and technology— all come together. And then I ended up in an operating room and finding that I had to try and do it.It seemed insane. You were opening people up; you were going to make them better, and things are complicated and wrong and you had imperfect information.And you had to come out the other end. And 97 percent - plus of these folks we were making better.So it introduced an entirely different level of complexity and understanding that I couldn t pull it all together. Does Oregon suggest we get way less from health care than we thought ? EK: There s been research about Medicaid, suggesting that health insurance may do a lot less to actually improve people s health outcomes than we thought. But it isn t clear that the care we re getting is doing all that much.So you talked about these particular operations where you re making 97 percent of people better, but has this strain of research led you to update or change your views on the worth of the medical care that we get in aggregate ? AG : Katherine Baicker is the economist who did a ton of this work out of Oregon, and Oregon was this amazing natural randomized experiment because they ran out of money and gave Medicaid coverage away in a lottery. And for two years, the lottery winners were the only ones to have that coverage, and so we could compare the two who got coverage and who didn t.And you re exactly right: [The ones with coverage] got more doctors visits. Kate took it even deeper than that— not just more doctor s visits; you had more operations, more emergency room visits, more hospital stays.You could begin to see what they got more of —they got more mental health care, more diabetes checks, more medication for blood pressure, more medication for their diabetes.But only certain things got better.Their diabetes didn t get better; their high blood pressure didn t get better; their mental health did get better. Over the course of two years, there are modest to little effects of getting access to more care in terms of survival or in terms of the control of specific chronic illnesses like diabetes and high blood pressure.What that said to me is that it reinforced what I feel like I was recognizing: The health care system massively underperforms. We already knew by that point that for people with high blood pressure, 60 percent do not have their blood pressure under control, even when they ve been seeing people in the medical system.We know that 40 percent of people with coronary artery disease are receiving incomplete and inappropriate care.We know that for mental health conditions it can be upward of 80 percent receiving incomplete and inappropriate care. [As detailed in Gawande s book The Checklist Manifesto]: In surgery, more than half of the deaths and major complications that occurred were from failure to deliver on existing knowledge on how to do better. We designed a checklist approach— basically, it s like a preflight checklist: Did you have all the equipment you need ? Have you taken into consideration the medical issues of the patient ? Is there anything that needs to be adjusted before you start in ? Did you have the blood in the room ? Does everyone in the room know each other by name ? Have the antibiotics been given ? And doing that, we lowered the death rate 47 percent in each city. You have this partisan debate over this research.The Republicans, or at least some Republicans, would attack it and say, Coverage for health insurance ? You don t even need it.It doesn t do any good.' And you have some Democrats saying, No, no, no, the research is wrong.'When the truth is you do need the coverage and the system is incredibly wasteful and disorganized.We re entering that space where you have to solve those problems of ineptitude, and we re starting to offer some solutions. EK : What is something you believe is true that most people believe is false ? AG : I think the thing I believe that others don t necessarily is that we fail all the time.That the reasons we re successful are because we set up systems that allow us to fail, get up, and move on— and that we re insufficiently forgiving of those kinds of failures. When you state it that way, people say, Yeah, I believe it.'But you look at their actions, you look at the way we have the expectation of perfection.You know, I certainly see it every day as a doctor— the urge to say, I m perfect.That nothing will go wrong.That we completely know what we re doing and everything will go smoothly. It s just not true.And yet you re better off going with me, our team, and doing what needs to be done.And people want to believe there is that perfection, there is that infallibility, and that s a blinder.It s a problem.",

Trevor Noah, the host of Comedy Central s The Daily Show, is funny.Very funny.Professionally funny. But what surprised me when I sat down with Noah for a recent episode of my podcast is just how serious he is too.In a conversation that ranged from what America could learn from South Africa s Truth and Reconciliation Commission to why the Obama era has worsened racial polarization to how tragedy gets absorbed into partisanship, Noah didn t crack many jokes.He didn t destroy or eviscerate anyone.But he made a lot of good points— points, in many cases, that I m still thinking about, weeks after our discussion. You can listen to our full discussion by streaming it here or by subscribing to the podcast on iTunes.What follows here are edited excerpts from a very serious conversation with a very funny man. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.For the full conversation, subscribe to my podcast! What Obama s presidency didn t change about race in America Ezra Klein: You had a great line that I ve been thinking about since I read it a number of months ago where you said, If you re black in the United States, even after two terms of President Obama, you still feel black. Do you feel like, watching the Obama presidency go forward, it has also shined light on what hasn t changed ? Trevor Noah : Yeah.It came with the illusion that everything would change.It came with the illusion that everything would become different. Ironically, what happens with every single black person is that black people are black people until they achieve a certain level of excellence, and then they become their name. I ll give you an example— Will Smith.Is Will Smith black, or is he Will Smith ? He s Will Smith.Tiger Woods was Tiger Woods— yeah, black golfer, but he was Tiger Woods. I find it strange that the bad apples in the black community will be used to tarnish the black community as a whole, but then the stellar performers will be somehow given a name that is outside of race.They will be given a position that is somehow precluded from race. So it s almost like Barack Obama, yes, that man has become the first black president.But in terms of black people, in terms of the country as a whole, people felt like that would extend everywhere.I know this because the anticipation and the excitement spread into Africa. EK: So if you get arrested, you re the example that proves the rule, but if you get out, you re the exception that proves the rule. TN: Exactly.That s what often happens.That s why they always say in black families everywhere that you have to be twice as good.Because you genuinely do .You have to be good for yourself, and you have to be good for the community as well, because if you fail, the community fails. It becomes, Ah, you see! Black man can t get a job, Black man can t get his shit together, Black man can t look after his kids, you know ? But then if you do well, it s like, Oh, wow, look at that. A black man who does look after his kids, as opposed to, Oh, black men do well. EK: How exhausting is it to have these expectations and fears in your head all the time ? TN : Black people are always living race.When you are driving or walking down the street and you hear a police siren, I do not know a black person who does not have a feeling, just for a moment, of , This could change my entire day. I ll be driving in my car, a police siren goes off behind me, and in that instant, I go, I don t know what s going to happen. Then it drives past me and I m like, Oh, okay. And everything is fine, I have my driver s license, I have no problems, I have a car that s licensed— but that sound could signal a change forever in my life. That is being black.You live with it at all times.You know that at any moment, it can happen to you by mistake.And that s a scary place to live in . EK: This seems like a reality we have trouble getting at in journalism.We can cover the big things, like the Fergusons, but we don t really have a way to talk about that moment of fear when the sirens turn on. TN: Imagine if you come from a world where you have no interactions with the police other than good interactions.You only know the police to be protecting and serving.You even know the police maybe by name.You live in a community where these are never issues for you.For somebody to come and tell you that a policeman would go out of his way to harm another person, I do not blame someone for thinking that is a complete lie.Why would the police ever do something like that ? It makes no sense. But as a black person, you feel crazy when people are like, You just can tell the officer they don t have the right to do that. You say, you know, I wish I had your guts. I can t believe you can just say that. And they re like, Yeah, you say, I need to see a warrant. You have no right! It s like, man, we don t live in the same world.We genuinely don t. Should America have a South Africa– style Truth and Reconciliation Commission ? EK : I saw you re writing a book. TN: I am.It s just me writing a few stories— and how they pertain to the world today, growing up in apartheid South Africa with my mom, and living in a post - racial society that was forged through racism. EK: What do you mean when you say a post-racial society ? TN : That s what South Africa aspired to.It s sort of the same thing America aspired to, South Africa, to a certain extent, has done that.It s moving to a place where most of your issues are not pinned back to race.Right now in America, a lot of the issues really do center around race.Over time, I think, in South Africa that became less and less[the case].They were still dealing with the effects of that government, but it s becoming less and less so.Now it s more about income and inequality. EK: It s interesting the way you say over time there, because apartheid in South Africa is both more extreme and ends much later than Jim Crow. So it doesn t seem intuitive that you would have a quicker path to a society where these issues do not pin back to race. TN: I think we are moving faster, yeah.One of the factors is that we had a Truth and Reconciliation Commission— we sat down, as a country, to come to grips with everything that had been done during the most oppressive time in our history. It was the oppressors and the oppressed sitting in a room together, with the whole country watching, and talking through everything that had happened.And it wasn t about punishing the people; it was about exactly what the name suggests— truth and reconciliation. It left us in a place where no one could deny what had happened.I see that in America where people ask questions like, Oh, was slavery that bad? Does slavery really have effects? and What is the worst thing that happened? There s some people who don t even believe half the stories of lynchings or police brutality.It s still an issue of , Well, I don t know if that s all true. I think the Truth and Reconciliation Commission really helped us do that, so we ve progressed.It s a different country, in that black people are the majority so the minority was oppressing the majority, as opposed to America s history. EK: I m gonna expose the vast acreage of my ignorance here and say that I don t know that much about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.So when you say that everybody was watching, what were they watching ? Were you watching this on television as a kid ? TN : It was more than news.It was primetime television. Imagine if Americans sat down and said, We are going to have a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. You would sit down with all of those who had instigated slavery or who had implemented Jim Crow— all of the people who ran police departments where they specifically set out to abuse minority groups. You sit down with those people— even white extremist organizations like the KKK— and you sat with them and you said, Listen, whatever you say now will be not held against you. If you tell the complete truth, it will in essence be forgiven, but the truth will be out there. Everyone out there will know what has happened, and you will talk through it. People will talk about how they set up housing so that black people couldn t live in good areas. They set it up so that loans couldn t be given to people of color; they set it up so that police departments would specifically target people of color for infractions that didn t exist. And that s what you d have to do as a country, and everyone would be watching that— and because it is the perpetrators who are confessing, and there s really no reason to lie.The truth is essentially what sets you free, and that s what we had to do . EK: Is there a story that you remember striking you with force ? TN : There was one member of the police force who told us the story of how he would train his dogs on actual black people who had been arrested.And so he would get the dogs to basically eat the black people in front of him. He would set them loose in a field, and the black people had to run.And the dogs had to chase them down, like Ramsay Bolton in Game of Thrones.The way he talked about this, and the way they couldn t defend themselves— and the way the person would try to fight the dog and he would beat them or he would shoot them.Over and over and over again.And that s how they trained their dogs. I remember that story stuck with me because the imagery was something I could almost see.I feel like I saw the actual event taking place. How The Daily Show tries to turn tragedy into comedy EK: Something that I m feeling acutely lately is the gruesomeness of the news cycle.This is a very depressing election, and of course we recently had a maniac drive a truck through dozens of people in France. Covering this stuff even in a fairly straightforward way takes an emotional toll.What does it take to go out and be funny about it ? TN : You know, what I ve come to realize in almost a year of doing The Daily Show now is that it s not about what you find funny in the situation. I use comedy now as a pressure release valve.So I dive in ; I explore what is happening, I respond to the true emotion of it, and then I use comedy as my release valve, because that s all I can do . Sometimes I use comedy as a catharsis that just helps me get through the anger, the pain, the dismay, the disappointment that I have in what s happening.But it s less and less about finding the funny. One of the things that broke my heart the most after this truck incident was the fact that it feels like every time these attacks happen, it feels like these people[the Islamic State] are winning— not because they re winning in terms of a body count or in terms of a war, but because they are successfully making us turn on each other.An attack happens, and within 15 minutes, maybe even 10, people online are fighting with each other ? It s like, Really, guys? Is this the time ? Is this really what s gonna move us forward ? It s now as though we are waiting for these attacks to help us prove a point— as opposed to working together to find a way to preserve human life.It s just a tool that we use to be right or wrong in an argument. EK: I d love to hear about this in a very operational way.Walk me through a joke that you re particularly proud of having appeared on air and how it went from you seeing a news story to you expressing something that felt true and made people laugh. TN: One was when we were talking about the shootings that were happening— Alton Sterling and Philando Castile— and it was around the notion that these cops body cameras at the moment of the altercation both became dislodged. Oh, they both became dislodged in the scuffle. I had said during the morning meeting, I call bullshit on that, because I ve seen white people cameras and they never come off. And then we just played a trailer of those GoPro ads, where people are falling down mountainsides and snowboarding and crashing through waves and mountain biking, and in every video they come out on the other side and the camera is perfectly intact and people are cheering and screaming. And that was one of those moments where you get to inject comedy in the right way, aiming at the specific thing you re trying to comment on, while at the same time not taking away the gravity of your argument. EK: It s become very clichéd to say that The Daily Show and places like it are the only outlets able to tell the truth about what s going on.Without backing that sentiment, I feel like there s this very interesting exception to the structure of opinionated versus objective journalism that has emerged within comedy.You can say things that are clearly quite pointed, but they evade a normal set of defenses, so you can say things that don t really have a place elsewhere in the media but often need to be said. It always felt to me that that has to be a somewhat tricky thing to balance— the balance between what is the best joke or what is the funniest joke tonight, and what do I want to say that feels important with that platform ? Is that a tension you feel ? TN : I ve come to the realization that the most important thing for my show is for me to tell the truth.That s honestly it.For me to tell the truth.It s the same thing you re trying to do at Vox.It s what you re saying to your writers. If you cannot be critical to yourself or to the side you say you support, then how can you expect the people you are arguing against to do the same ? That is a big problem that I notice, especially in American politics— both sides gloss over their problems and then quickly pivot and turn to the other side. Ask Paul Ryan if he supports Donald Trump and what he s saying, and Paul Ryan will within a few sentences pivot and say, I think the bigger question we have to ask ourselves is, ‘Will Hillary stick to conservative values and will Hillary represent conservative voters? And it s like, we didn t ask you that.We said, Do you think Donald Trump will be a good president? Do you think Donald Trump represents your views? And both sides do it.Both sides do the exact same thing.People aren t critical of their own sides.You saw it with the Bernie Sanders movement.If you dared question the numbers of Bernie s campaign, if you dared question his policies on trade, you would enter into a war where you would dread the day you ever mentioned his name.And yet you were going, But I thought we were all working in the same space. I like Bernie Sanders. But doesn t that mean I should hold him to a high standard? It s the same thing essentially that goes for the police.If you are pro - police, wouldn t you want to hold them to a higher standard ? Wouldn t you want them to be beyond reproach or as close to that place as possible ? Because you are a fan of what they do, you respect the position of what they hold— why wouldn t you want that ? The best advice Trevor Noah got was from Dave Chappelle EK: What s the best advice you ve received ? TN : The best piece of advice was probably from Dave Chappelle.It was before I started the show, and he said to me, Whatever you do, don t let them steal your joy. And that I have applied not just to my show but to life.Don t let people steal your joy.Don t let people convince you that you are not happy.Don t let them try and bring you into a world where you are miserable with them. EK: How are you able to do that ? TN : Just by remembering.Going home, talking to friends, realizing that a lot of the time these are champagne problems. If I have a problem with a TV show in the United States of America, that s a champagne problem to have.Twenty years ago my problem was the fact that I didn t have a flushing toilet.That was a problem.Twenty - five years ago my problem was the fact that I couldn t be seen in the streets with my mom or my dad, because one of them would be arrested and I would be taken away to an orphanage.That was a problem. So for me, it s reminding myself of the level or the degree of problem.I go, Oh, man, these are not things for which I will allow someone to steal my joy. Someone tweeted me something horrible, it s like, yeah, whatever.I would worry more if the real people in your world were saying horrible things and Twitter was saying nice things.Then you should worry.But in my world, real people are good people and Twitter people can be whatever they want. Trevor Noah: host of Comedy Central s The Daily Show Trevor Noah Noah recommended Freakonomics, by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, as a simple book that expands your mind. Noah also selected Between the World and Me, by Ta - Nehisi Coates. It was just an honest point of view — it wasn t optimistic; it was just a powerful piece of literature that really changed my life, Noah said.",

Written before Make America Great Again became the rallying cry of the Republican Party, it argues that both Democrats and Republicans were trapped inside a dangerous nostalgia, and tried to propose a way out. I interviewed Levin for my podcast this week (subscribe here!). What follows is an edited transcript of our conversation about the Republican Party— the full podcast covers much more ground, including Levin s time working for George W.Bush and Newt Gingrich, the lessons he learned in the White House, his favorite policy books, and much more. Ezra Klein: So I want to start with an odd question: What is the Republican Party ? Yuval Levin : It s an odd question that has to be asked now, of course.Any political party is an institution that exists to advance some vision of good and that exists to allow a coalition to cohere.A party is always both of those things. I think the Republican Party has thought of itself more in recent decades as the first, as a vehicle for a vision of the world, a vehicle for conservatism.In reality, of course, it s been at least as much of the latter.I think some of the problems it s had is that its own leaders have not seen that as clearly as they might and have assumed that the Republican electorate is more of a conservative electorate than it s been. EK: What do you think happened inside the party this year ? It feels like the institution has changed, but how do you locate where that change happened ? YL : For a long time now, the political class of the Republican Party has had a view of its own voters that has been an error.It s looked at the base as a conservative voting base. That view of the electorate has meant that a lot of Republican politicians think they can approach the Republican Party as an essentially conservative institution. The conservative movement, which is different from the Republican Party, has thought this way too, and has had a possessive approach rather than a persuasive approach to Republican voters. There have been people, and I ve been one of them for about 10 years now, arguing that this is false.That especially the evidence of presidential elections should let us see that that s false.The party that has nominated Bob Dole and George W.Bush and John McCain and Mitt Romney is not in fact an intensely conservative party but is in fact a coalition in which conservatives are one very important group that has to persuade the rest by showing them why what it offers should be of interest to them. But the party hasn t done nearly enough of that, and instead has let itself become a vehicle for a very specific, and I think in some important respects, anachronistic agenda.And what s happened is the agenda s grown further and further from the actual problems people face. And so there really has been a growing distance between the Republican political class and the Republican electorate, and Trump in a lot of ways has showed that.He paid no attention to all of those litmus tests that all the politicians thought they had to meet.I think he literally wasn t even aware of them.He instead made a case that at least articulated some of the anxieties people had. And the response of a lot of the political class, best embodied by Ted Cruz, was basically to go around saying, He s not a conservative. He s not your guy. And voters in state after state responded saying, Yeah, he s not a conservative. What else do you have? EK: Trump says people are worried about immigrants, about Muslims, about disorder.But one thing I hear often in response to Trump is an effort to take his message and make it about economic anxiety.More than I think Trump had an agenda that spoke to people, I think he s emphasized issues that both conservative and liberal elites prefer to avoid, and they keep trying to reply with another conversation about tax policy. YL: I agree with that in part.I think that to look at Trump as fundamentally expressing economic anxieties surely is a mistake.In fact, I think that Trump himself views these things as more economic than the voters who support him do .Trump talks a lot about trade.His voters don t seem to care a lot about trade.They re much more impressed with the Muslim ban; they re much more impressed with the concern about immigration. But it does seem to me that some of the anxieties we see channeled in the Trump phenomenon are things could be addressed by a different approach to public policy.Trying to understand the concerns voters are raising as a question to which there could be an answer within our system of government is kind of what politicians do . What worries me, and really the essence of the book I ve just published, is that neither the left nor the right is actually doing this very well.Both of them are trying to ignore some key realities of 21 st - century life and to have an argument about whether we should go back to the high points of late - 20 th - century conservatism or late - 20 th - century liberalism, whether we should relive the late 1960 s or the early 1980 s.I think there s a very plausible left / right politics of 21 st - century America, but it s not the politics we have. The deep nostalgia of both political parties EK: Let s talk a bit about that nostalgia argument.You could barely get a better object lesson for your book than a guy who runs around saying, Make America Great Again. And the again in that slogan is so brilliant. Make America Great, I think you could easily forget about. Make America Great Again — the whole thing works because of that again. But tell me why you think the two parties are so gripped by nostalgia, because, having read your argument on this, I m conflicted on it.I m not sure I m persuaded— or at least I m not sure I m clear on what a politics that did not use the past as a framework for looking at the future would look like. YL: Yeah, so I m certainly not arguing for a politics that doesn t use the past as a framework for the future.I m a conservative, so I m even more inclined than most to use the past as a reference.But I think looking to the past for lessons is not the same as nostalgia.And part of what we re seeing in our politics now is a sense that we had all the answers at some point.I think Hillary Clinton, in the interview you did with her, literally said this: We were on the right track and we lost our way. EK: About the 90s. YL: About the 90s, yeah. And, you know, she kind of has to say that about the 90 s.A lot of liberal economic rhetoric says that now about the 70s or the pre- 70 s and thinks that we lost our way with the resurgence of excessively market - oriented economics in the late 70s. Conservatives say this about everything that happened after 1989. On the left, people tend to think about this in economic terms, so you look to the postwar decades as a time when the economy worked for workers, when people had a lot of opportunity regardless of their skill level, unions were very strong, people had a lot of faith and confidence in government.And you had this kind of corporatism where large corporations working together with a powerful labor movement and a powerful government seemed to be managing things. On the right, people talk about the culture of that period— strong families, probably the peak in American history in church attendance, very low divorce rates, and very low immigration. EK: I think you re right to say that there s nostalgia, but it s certainly not an uncomplicated nostalgia.The Democratic Party is very aware that that period worked a lot better for straight white men than for other groups.Republicans look at a lot of the economics of that era with distaste. YL: The nostalgia of the left and right are selective in quite different ways that prevent us from seeing what are really two sides of the same coin.Conservatives are nostalgic for the culture of midcentury America and are very happy, generally speaking, with how things have changed in economic terms.We love the dynamism of the modern economy, but we don t love the chaos of modern culture. Liberals are roughly the other way.They very much miss the structure and order and security of the midcentury economy, the stability for workers, the breadth of opportunity, but liberals are very happy with what s happened to the culture over this period.It s more diverse, it s much more open and dynamic, it s much more accepting of traditionally mistreated groups, there s much more immigration, we re a much more diverse society. The trouble is that these are two sides of the same coin.Liberalization has happened both in the culture and in the economy.In the culture it has meant that our society is more open, is more diverse.At the same time, if you want to look at the dark side of it, there is less structure, there is less social order.Families are more broken than they used to be— communities too.That can t be separated from the greater market orientation of the economy. I think the hardest thing about living in a basically functional, free society is always to see that our problems are the costs we pay for our strengths. EK: But that s partly because which parts are progress and which parts are problems is contested, right ? I think when we operate at the level of abstraction, when we just say social progress comes along with cost, everybody nods their head.That s actually an easy thing to say.It s when you get specific that things get harder. I think that s partly because we tend to flatten these issues into debates over efficiency.We are very comfortable debating whether or not something works and not very comfortable debating its fundamental morality.We just saw the Supreme Court case on abortion where laws meant to curb the overall numbers of abortions in Texas were being sold as an effort to improve women s health, and the Supreme Court ultimately just said, That s ridiculous. The values argument is hard to have, it s fuzzy to have, and there s no real way to resolve it, so things get transmuted into these much more technical, wonkish arguments where at least we can pretend to ourselves, Oh, if we could only convince everyone that it did help the economy or it did help this group, then it would be okay. YL: I think that s right, and it runs very deep in classical liberal politics.We want to say that what it means to be a free society is that people can believe what they want to about moral issues, but we can have a debate about how to create the right environment for people who have the freedom to do what they choose.That means that a lot of our governing equations only make sense to us, only seem legitimate to us, when they are questions about utilitarian matters, when they re questions about what works and what s efficient. But of course we can t actually have a society that doesn t argue with itself about moral questions— and we shouldn t. EK: Let s say that in this election, Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton.Say he loses by 6 points— a reasonably significant but normal margin.What do you think happens in the Republican Party after that ? YL : The only honest answer is I have no idea.If you talk to members of Congress, most of them would say that what happens is a return to what they consider normal, pre - Trump politics.The Republican Party, below the level of the presidency, is the governing party of the country.It s very dominant in governorships and state legislature seats and in Congress.That Republican Party has 10, 000 elected officials, none of them is Donald Trump, and none of them is much like Donald Trump.They think that party is still there.If this stops at the presidential level, that s the party that comes back. I think more would change than that.I think the lessons of this campaign season will sink in over time.I will not pretend to know what they re all going to be.An optimistic take on that, from my point of view, would be that there is a modernization of the party s understanding of the country s challenges.That there would be a generational change.There s a huge difference between older Republicans and younger Republicans among the elected officials and among voters.I think that kind of generational change could be a good thing. EK: What is the difference, in your experience, between older elected Republicans and younger elected Republicans ? YL : Well, I think the core difference has to do with whether your political consciousness was formed in the Reagan era or after.Many Republican politicians, those over 55, 60, really live with a Reagan - era sense of who the voters are, what the country s like, what the party s for. Younger Republican politicians are much more at home in 21 st - century America.They don t look at the country and say, I don t recognize my country. This is their country.I think they re less inclined to just repeat the policy agenda of the 1980 s; they re looking for ways of applying conservative ideas to 21 st - century problems. [Utah Sen.] Mike Lee is a great example of that.Mike Lee, in some ways, is the most conservative member of Congress, but in other ways is the most impressive policy entrepreneur among the Republicans.I think those two things are connected.It s not that being younger means you re less conservative; it means you have a different attitude about what the purpose of politics is and what conservatives might have to offer. The difference is enormous, and it s not just about the politicians.People my age— I m 39— people my age and younger don t watch Fox News at all.We haven t in years.They don t live in quite the political culture that seems to be defining this presidential race.And on the whole, they are mystified and horrified by what s going on in this presidential race. EK: What is the most interesting policy idea on the right and on the left in the past couple of years ? YL : I think the most interesting thing going on in the left is the debate about the guaranteed minimum income.It s not a new idea, and in fact there ve been debates about it several times in our history.If you look at the fall 1969 issue of the Public Interest[journal], it was devoted to a debate about a guaranteed minimum income. But circumstances have changed, and I think that argument on the left now is a very, very interesting argument.On the whole, the left has tended to want to double down on a kind of Great Society vision of how public programs work.I think the[universal basic income] is quite different from that and suggests something interesting about what might be coming.I think there are also ideas about offering public programs as options in private markets.That s a very interesting debate on the left, and in some ways very promising. On the right, I think a lot of what s going on is about making public policy, including at the national level, to enable experimentation at the local level.Now, in the abstract, conservatives have talked about that forever, but I think we have seen more work being done in recent years— both at the local level, especially in education, and somewhat at the national level— that tries to make that a little more real. The promising thing for me is that these two actually fit together pretty well.They suggest a kind of 21 st - century policy debate that s about how to enable more private sector options from the right, more public sector options from the left.These two could actually work together pretty well and in some respects could even improve one another somewhat. So there s a promise thereof a potentially constructive 21 st - century policy debate, in a country where everyone expects to have a lot of choices in every realm of life.That makes sense to me to have as a debate.But that s an optimistic way of thinking about where our policy debates are going.

Hillary Clinton: former Secretary of State, 2016 Democratic nominee hillary clinton What s on Clinton s bookshelf ? Clinton recommended Christopher Lasch s work and Alan Wolfe s work and Habits of the Heart a 1985 sociology book about individualism in American society. You can see how more difficult it is in a 24/7, 360-degree media environment to find the time to think, to breathe, to spend relaxation hours getting to know people, Clinton said. She also cited Harvard professor Robert Putnam s Our Kids: the American Dream in Crisis as key to understanding the economic and class divisions in much of America. Clinton says of Putnam s book: There s a really great story that he tells about going back to the town he grew up in outside of Cleveland, where kids of all different backgrounds, economic family standing, and they re all together and everyone was in it together. And there was so little distinction, and there was so much economic integration in that small town.Now he goes back to it, and it s so divided.So I think that s a book people should read right now.",

This episode is interesting even if you love your animal protein and will never, ever give it up: we're really talking here about the science of flavor, the business of food, and whether you can combine technology and marketing to change the most entrenched consumer behaviors of all. It ll be very hard to effectively combat climate change so long as meat consumption keeps soaring. That s the conclusion of leading researchers at Oxford, who found earlier this year that emissions from food production will eat up a whopping 50 percent of our carbon budget in a few decades.And it s the motivation behind Impossible Foods, a company that s trying to revolutionize meat consumption by creating a plant - based burger that it hopes will taste better than the real thing. We had to make something that a meat lover will prefer to what they re getting today from an animal, says Patrick Brown, the company s founder and CEO. We have to clear a very high bar because we have to produce a product that — for a consumer who s not gonna cut us any breaks — outperforms as a burger what we re getting today from a cow. If you do that, they ll switch. On the latest episode of The Ezra Klein Show, Klein and Brown discuss the origins of Impossible Foods, the key ingredient in a delicious plant - based burger, and how Impossible Foods is aiming to borrow from the Tesla playbook.(You can listen to the episode at the link below or, better yet, subscribe to the show on iTunes.) Brown, who rose to prominence as a geneticist at Stanford, helped pioneer DNA technology that transformed genetic research.That academic background may seem a surprising fit for the startup world, but it helps explain how Brown has successfully engineered a veggie burger that bleeds. A transcript of the first half of their conversation, edited for length and clarity, is transcribed below. Why Impossible Foods is trying to compete with the meat industry on its own terms Ezra Klein: So I had your burger yesterday, and it was life - changing.It felt like you guys had managed to create a burger without quite creating meat.It has a kind of iron taste; it has that meaty umami. It was an amazing way of decomposing and recomposing a food.How do you do that ? Patrick Brown : We approach the problem completely differently, because the only customer that we care about— given our mission— is someone who loves meat, is not looking for an alternative, and is not gonna compromise on the pleasure of eating meat for some principle or because they re concerned about the climate impact or something like that. That s our target customer.And because they will not compromise on any of the things they value about meat, the challenge for us is much, much harder than just making something a good - faith effort at a burger - like entity that someone doesn t want to eat. We had to make something that a meat lover will prefer to what they re getting today from an animal— and that meant we had to approach it as a very deep scientific problem.We had to understand in great detail what it is about the burger in molecular terms that gives it that very distinctive flavor and aroma and handling properties and cooking properties and texture and juiciness and stuff like that. And then we had to figure out where to get the ingredients from— sustainable, scalable, affordable plant sources that had this very precise set of properties that would enable us to create a product that would satisfy meat lovers.And that s just never been done before. EK: Given how cheap meat it is— and how delicious it is— why would a meat lover switch ? Why go after them at all ? PB : We have to clear a very high bar, because we have to produce a product that— for a consumer who s not gonna cut us any breaks— outperforms as a burger what we re getting today from a cow.If you do that, they ll switch. We have a lot of data from a large kind of consumer test that we did a few months ago, with 600 burger eaters in four cities around the country.We gave them our burger and asked, If you could choose between this and the burger that you ve been buying at the same price, which would you choose? and they choose ours by two to one.... What it told us was that people who love meat love it because it s delicious, affordable, nutritious, familiar, and it s got some kind of cultural resonance for them.The fact that it s made from an animal has never been part of the value proposition. They have never seen...any meat that they found delicious that wasn t made from an animal— so it s not a thought experiment they ve done.When they actually see it, they can now consider the fact that if it s made from an animal...it s got a lot of negatives associated with it.There are public health issues; there are food safety risks; there s antibiotics and hormones that go into it; the cholesterol, even the environmental impact, is not going to change their behavior per se, but more and more people are aware of it, and it bothers them. How Impossible Foods is trying to model itself after Tesla EK: I m so fascinated by the way you have structured the business of this, because it seems to me that you have a set of scientific innovations and then a set of business innovations or business strategies.The two things are related but different. It feels to me that what you re trying to do inmeat is what Tesla did in electric cars.That there had been electric cars before Tesla, but they had sort of been aimed at hippies; they had been aimed at people who maybe already felt bad about the car. PB: They were already looking for something like that, and they were willing to compromise on performance and affordability and stuff like that, because doing something that had less of a negative impact on the environment was sufficiently important for them. I think in quite a lot of ways, those are legitimate parallels.If your goal is to address a big global issue— and that was ours and, I assume, Tesla s— at least a big part of their motivating goals to begin with is that you don t do that by having a successful niche product.You have to have something that the mainstream consumer will want to buy for all the reasons that drive them to make a particular choice. It means you have to have a much higher standard of quality, affordability, and so forth, or you re just wasting your time.That was, I think, Tesla s thesis, and it was ours for sure. The thing about starting at a relatively discerning consumer— particularly an uncompromising consumer and a higher price point— is necessary because until we reach a certain scale, we don t have the economies of scale, and it s hard for us to be competing with mass - market ground beef.But we can be competitive with organic ground beef or the stuff that you would eat at a premium burger joint or a restaurant. So for practical reasons, that s a reasonable choice.Our scale is small, so we can only serve a certain number of consumers.For each consumer we serve, we want to maximize the brand - building value.So I think it just turns out that it s necessary, but it s also, I think, a good strategic choice. EK: What struck me as so interesting about the way you re framing it to me here— and the way Tesla s framed things for a long time as a business question— is that both of you deemphasize what one would think of as the core value of the product.Which is to say you re trying to make a burger in which its plant origins are almost incidental to its appeal. PB: Yes.I wouldn t say they re completely incidental, but if you don t compete successfully on the things that are the major drivers of the consumers choices for that category of product, you re never gonna have a significant impact. So you have to focus on that first.To some degree, the more you emphasize things that are important to us— the fact that it s made from plants, it s got a much lower environmental impact, it s better for public health, and all that sort of stuff— if you start talking about that too much, then people start to think, Well, that s what the story s all about. That means you re asking me to compromise on the things that are more important to me, which is deliciousness. And I think it s the same with electric cars. If you frame it as this is much better for the environment — for me, if I see a product in the grocery store and it says gluten-free, it s kind of synonymous with you re compromising flavor for something I don t care that much about. It s kind of a backhanded way of saying we re asking you to compromise on the things you care about. How Impossible Foods thinks of its environmental mission EK: How did you turn to this problem ? When was the first time you thought about the problem of , can a burger be created— can meat be created that is based on plants and is more appealing than animal products ? PB : What I thought of first was that using animals as a food production technology is the biggest threat, by substantial margins, to the global environment today. And that s something that is more widely recognized than you d think by people in the environmental sciences and the climate sciences world, although it gets virtually no airtime. People recognize it as a problem, but they don t see it as a solvable problem because they know that people aren t going to change their diets.They ll say, We don t see a realistic solution to addressing climate change that doesn t involve a substantial change in kind of dietary patterns. But it s kind of unimaginable that that will happen, so it really doesn t get spoken about a lot.I came on thinking, I want to solve that problem. Using animals as technology for producing foods is incredibly destructive and inefficient— and it s an urgent problem, because the environmental impact it has is really pushing us into a really dangerous place. EK: When you ask the question, Why does meat taste like meat? what are the questions that actually resolves into ? My intuition is that it ends up not being the real question— that there s some set of things happening that aren t just taste, that are coming together to create the impression of meat. PB: A lot of these compounds— they re not meat - specific.What that means is that you can actually find the ingredients from other natural sources.You just have to bring them together in the right way, and that is perceived unmistakably as meat. [Brown s central innovation was using a plant-based molecule called heme to recreate something resembling cow blood; he s touted it as the secret sauce to the taste of his veggie burgers ] ...It s in every living cell on Earth— it s not meat - specific by a long shot.But it s the compound in your blood that carries oxygen, it s what makes your blood red, it s what gives it its high iron content, and it s super abundant in the animal tissues that we call meat.Which is why red meat is red and white meat is pink— because it s got a lot of heme.Like I said, plants have heme, bacteria have heme, yeast have heme, but meat has insanely high concentrations of heme.... If you look at the stuff that s on the market as meat replacements— I know from people in the industry— their most expensive ingredients are the artificial flavors they buy from a flavor house.But we just use these simple and readily available amino acids and things like that, and we get them for free.",

This is a fascinating conversation about some genuinely tricky topics. It's left me with a lot to think about, and I believe it'll do the same for you. Heather McGhee thought about changing the name of the progressive think tank Demos when she became its president in 2014. The name sounded stuffy.Few people knew what the ancient Greek word meant. People always ask if it stands for something or if it was an acronym, she says. It was a bit of a mess, public relations–wise. But McGhee ultimately decided that Demos, which means the people of a democracy, was actually the perfect fit for the organization s mission.Exactly who gets included in the body politic— figuring out what the Demos is— is really the central struggle of American politics, McGhee said. I think there s something beautiful about the idea that becoming a Demos, becoming a unified people, is in fact our biggest project in this country. It s not at the level of an incremental public policy. It s about a fundamental level of who we define as an American, she says. In the latest installment of The Ezra Klein Show, Klein and McGhee talk about her time working for John Edwards, discuss what the TV show The West Wing gets wrong(and right) about modern liberalism, and delve into the influence of money on politics.(You can listen to the interview here or subscribe to the show on iTunes.) But their discussion is mostly about why overcoming racial divisions is the first and overriding challenge to any truly successful progressive movement— and why Donald Trump s racialized rhetoric may help that effort by bringing the conflict to the surface. This is the fight. This is absolutely the fight as demographic change helps America fulfill its destiny as a people, McGhee says. We can either say we re meeting here to compete with one another or all the world s people are meeting here to give lie to the idea of racial difference. A lightly edited transcript from the interview is below. Ezra Klein: How are you enjoying 2016 so far ? Heather McGhee : As ugly as it s been, I think these are the undercurrents of our politics all the time.So I m glad we re having them out. EK: That s interesting.What do you mean by that ? HM : Most people who support Trump will say, He s saying what he thinks. And what they re really saying is, He s saying what I m thinking. This country is at such a moment of profound demographic change, layered in with economic inequality and tectonic shifts of how we live, that for our politics to not be explicitly related to that conversation and working it out just allows for them to be dog whistles and unconsciously exploited fears and anxieties. EK: Do you think that when our politics explicitly engages in these questions we make them better or we make them worse ? In 08, there s all this talk about Obama being a post-racial president. Then he gets elected and our politics becomes more structured by race. Now if you poll anything that touches on race, it s sharply divided on racial lines. We seem to have, instead of working out racial disagreement through politics, added our political disagreements to race. HM: There is a simple answer, which is that Barack Obama was an incredibly compelling candidate and that those who refused to vote for him may have had strong racial feelings, so the people who moved to the Democratic Party were those who were by definition willing to vote for a black man. That s sort of the simple answer.I think the more complex answer is that we re hopefully near the endpoint of a three - generation reshuffling of our partisan affiliations by identity.One that began with the Southern strategy and has had valences around things we think of in non - racialized terms— how big you want government to be, how high you want taxes to be— but a lot of research has shown that those questions are, of course, questions that can fall on the fundamental building block of your identity, which in this country is race. How racism caused the cost of college to rise EK: This idea that the Democratic Party looks at racism as something that wholly hurts folks of color and helps whites.What do you mean when you say the left has to move beyond that ? HM : As a black woman and descendant of slaves in this country, I am by no means minimizing the harm racism is doing to black people in this country or the danger of deportation— the list could go on. However, if you think of the well - founded economic anxiety and insecurity that many white families are feeling today… if our politics requires a sense of moral altruism from white voters to support the cause of racial justice, that s a pretty high bar. Fortunately, I don t think the facts bear out the idea that white people benefit from the kind of racism that we have today and that people of color are the only people who are harmed.… Ezra, you and I both came up in the idea of a very economically progressive story that talked about the postwar period from the mid - 40s to the mid-1970s as an era of broad economic prosperity, of a compact between labor and government — and it was true. And then something shifted. You can start telling the story of what happened in the mid - 1970 s as a story that doesn t include race at all— about the Powell memo, about corporations learning to organize, about anodyne forces like globalization and technological change. But the real story has to include race, how it was that the white vote shifted so dramatically after the civil rights era and a new racial formation of the conservative party[arose].This question— do we order our society so there are big progressive public investments in all of us ? That became a lot harder to say yes to when that public didn t look like you.… White voters became alienated from the idea of government and government benefits because they didn t, in the conservative methodology, benefit them.It benefited the other.Has that hurt inner - city communities ? Absolutely.But it s also led to a tripling in the cost of tuition over the past generation. EK: As I understand the argument, the point is this: The way in which racism has begun to have victims who are not just nonwhite is that it s been used to discredit a broad variety of government programs and forms of government action that really were oriented to class. That racism has been used as a form of class war that s also been very bad for poor whites. HM: That s exactly right. Take, for example, the cost of college.Ronald Reagan ran to successfully marry the public image with government spending with undeserving minorities who were either undeserving because they were criminal or because they were lazy, like the welfare queen. If you have a broad rejection of government spending— as the famous Lee Atwater quote goes: Once you start talking about cuts instead of saying the n - word, it s a lot more subtle but you get the same effect. Now, that is true, but what s also true is that white families need government too.In fact, government helped create the white working class.And nowhere is it more vivid than in the rising cost of college. We re releasing a video at Demos that shows how racism has raised the rising cost of college.The main driver is a massive set of cuts at the state level— about a quarter of every dollar per pupil— and what s been the background driver of all these cuts ? The conservative ideology.… It s not really clear why a base white conservative really wants a small government or spending cuts.Why am I driven to the polls to cut spending ? It s in large part, and lots of research shows this, that government spending has been racialized.… What does this point to in terms of strategy ? That progressives can t point to saying government this, government that, without dealing with the underlying racial dynamics.You can t deal with the Bernie Sanders expansion of government that make us look more like Denmark when our people don t look like Denmark. Even if you want an entirely economic agenda, that requires you to do the hard work on race. EK: I think what s being said here is that modern conservatism is a second - best compromise between a donor class that wants lower taxes and less regulations and a second group of lower - class whites that doesn t want to be paying taxes where those benefits are going to voters of color or unauthorized immigrants or the other. In many ways it seems like, in his rhetoric if not his policy proposals, that Donald Trump is trying to pull that apart by attacking the donor class.That he s going to have a huge state, but he s going to make sure that the money will go to you— the people who Made America Great— rather than, implicitly, people of color. HM: When people ask me, What do you think of this election; are you just horrified? I say, Yes, of course I m horrified, but I think this is an important part of our political growing up. Donald Trump by making dog whistles explicit… is signing the divorce papers for what has been an unholy marriage in the conservative coalition.My response is to respond to the false patriotism of Donald Trump with a true patriotism.I m a very patriotic person— even though I m a black, liberal woman.[laughs] I m very patriotic because I believe if America is exceptional it s because of the great diversity of our people, and I believe it s time for a new story about who we are as a country that says our diversity is our greatest asset.That who we re becoming demographically— a pluralistic nation with no racial majority— is not the unmaking of America but the fulfillment of it. We are a country that is not united by race or creed or religion or any other identifying factor.So we have to stop denying that s who we are and actually say that s what makes us great.That requires a whole different set of social institutions, that building a sense of solidarity and community is itself work and should be the work of our politics.In his best moments, the president was able to do that— to wrap that plurality in the flag— and it s not surprising you re seeing a backlash with Donald Trump. But this is the fight.This is absolutely the fight as demographic change helps America fulfill its destiny as a people.We can either say we re meeting here to compete with one another or all the world s people are meeting here to give lie to the idea of racial difference. Who does the Democratic Party represent ? Democratic Party diversity EK: When you look back at The West Wing, President Bartlett didn t get anything done at all.The stuff he really worked to get done was the most small - bore— add mammograms to Medicare, make college tuition deductible.In the Bush era, liberals felt so connected to that vision of politics. Then Obama came in , and the stuff he passed would have looked ridiculous on that show; he never even would have attempted it.The Democratic Party s ambitions between 1996 and 2008 rose really dramatically— there was a sense within it that they were culturally out of step with the party, but to win and hold power they had to compromise with a political center that wasn t where they were.And the more recent incarnations of the party are quite emboldened from that period. HM: They need to be.Half of the American people can t pay a $400 bill that arrives on their doorstep without going into debt or selling something.We have an existential crisis to humanity in global climate change.This is not a time for small ideas— school uniforms and things like that.This is a time when our political system has become so out of touch with not just the wishes but urgent needs of the vast majority of the American people that big structural change is needed. At Demos, we do a lot of research in partnership with political scientists on just how inequality in our democracy is creating inequality in our economy— and what a feedback loop it is.… EK: Who do you think the Democratic Party serves ? HM : The very cynical part of me thinks both parties serve the people who pay them— fundamentally, the people from who they can raise money.And it really can t be overstated what a small slice of the American people actually give in any significant amount to federal candidates, and how distorted the demographics of that population are. Over 90 percent of the gifts from the candidates came from majority - white neighborhoods.It shouldn t be a surprise that then 90 percent of our elected officials are white, even though the country is about 40 percent people of color.So we have a lot to do . EK: So what does a less cynical part of you think ? HM : [Laughs] The less cynical part of me, when I think about who the Democratic Party serves, thinks that what unites people to the Democratic Party banner is an idea of a government that works in the public interest— an idea of linked fate across race and identity.And in many ways that s easier to say now that it was 20 years ago.There is more ideological coherence to the Democratic Party now, and that s a good thing.Because particularly on economic issues, that bolder more progressive vision is more in line with what working - and middle - class families want and need.",

      "description": "My guest on this episode is Jesse Eisenberg — who you may know as Lex Luthor in Batman V. Superman, Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network, or Daniel Atlas in the just-released Now You See Me 2.I was apprehensive about this interview. I haven't interviewed many movie stars. But this turned out to be one of the most natural, easy, and interesting conversations I've had for the show. Eisenberg is a cerebral Jewish writer who sees the world through the lens of sociolology and has a lot of trouble relaxing. So we had a lot to talk about, including:- Jewish humor and the dangers of assimilation- How it's different to write for the page than the stage- Whether Eisenberg has become happier as he's become more successful- What he learned backpacking through China- Why his family never takes vacations- How he turns the tables on fans who stop him in the street- Why he thinks it's easier to ask extremely personal questions of total strangers, and why it's worth doing- How his training as an actor helps him understand Donald TrumpAnd much more.

So, so much more. Jesse Eisenberg walks past the same poster everyday in London s historic West End on his way to perform The Spoils, a play he wrote and stars in . The poster promotes the show and prominently displays Eisenberg s face.It s also covered with quotes from glowing reviews proclaiming The Spoils a triumph. Eisenberg hates seeing it.It s not that the actor, author, and screenwriter isn t grateful for the acclaim.It s that he fears some of the night s audience will see the poster on their way to the show and leave disappointed if it turns out not to meet the elevated expectations. All I see when I see that image is terror, Eisenberg says. I don t feel glee, or joy, or accomplishment. … It s pure terror. It s, How am I going to live up to what I ve promised they re going to be paying for? On the latest episode of The Ezra Klein Show, Eisenberg ties together his persistent, probing urge to always improve his work with being an American Jew.To him, a big reason he s been successful is because of his inability to really draw satisfaction from that success. Eisenberg s worry — a central theme of his new show — is that without this prickling ambition, both he as an individual and Jewish Americans more generally will lose the edge that has made their rise possible. I have a feeling, and it s this: When Jews were hungry in America, they accomplished a lot, says Eisenberg, who is starring in Now You See Me 2, which is out this month. As a Jewish person, it feels like I could have assimilated into white hegemonic culture and be totally comfortable and go out to the Hamptons or go golfing or whatever people do. I don t want to do that because I feel like I will, to quote Woody Allen, ‘ripen and then rot. Eisenberg and Klein s conversation covers a wide range of topics— including how an actor views Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton— and you should download and listen to it.(Or go here to subscribe to the podcast.) We ll be pulling out and highlighting some of those exchanges later in the week. But their exchange about Jewish identity seemed worth reproducing in full below— not because of its references to Borscht Belt humor and Jewish mothers(though I personally enjoyed that) but for the light it sheds on a much bigger question about the compulsions driving overachievers and whether the path to success is necessarily fraught with self - loathing. Below is a lightly edited transcript of a section from the interview. Ezra Klein: You talked a lot about Jewish humor, and I read a great interview you did with Tablet about this.And you said something— I m Jewish and have read a lot of fiction in that tradition— and you said: Jews have a way of both assimilating and separating, and they do it very deftly. I wanted to hear you talk about that, because it s something I ve thought about a lot but have never been able to define that articulately. Jesse Eisenberg: I see it happen as acutely as my family and as broadly as reading Philip Roth, or seeing a Woody Allen movie or even a Mel Brooks movie, which may be even more indicative of assimilated humor than Woody Allen. If it benefits the culture to be seamlessly integrated into the hegemony in America, then they do that.Not in a Machiavellian, selfish way but in a survival way.And then, conversely, if it benefits them to be an exotic outsider, then they do that.I don t think there s anything wrong with that kind of code - switching.Everybody in every culture does some version of that, but Jews— based on their history and appearance— have been able to do it very successfully in many different places. EK: …There has been a real sense of Jews as the other. And it seems like there haven t been very many times where for very long we were able to just become part of the whole. If you go back to the early 20 th century, Italians and Poles and ethnic white folks eventually got assimilated into whiteness.They were considered to be other races, and even today Jews stand more separate than that. JE: I think that s probably by choice.At the turn of the century my family had a dry goods store in southeast Poland, and according to my aunt— who is 104— they were totally, seamlessly integrated in this town, and it wasn t until the war broke out that the Poles turned against them.… I think the Jews, in terms of keeping one foot outside the door— and I ve thought about that a lot in terms of myself— I think they do that for survival in America.That s paradoxical in a way: Why wouldn t they want to fully assimilate into white American culture ? And I have a feeling, and it s this : When Jews were hungry in America they accomplished a lot, and now there s a kind of relaxed quality— that if we relax too much and assimilate too much, either something bad will happen, which has historically occurred, or we re not going to accomplish that much.Because we re going to have our nice apartment, and that s it.And we ll stop. And one of the things my play is about in London is my character is a third - generation Jewish American, the son of a dentist.And his roommate is a Nepalese immigrant who came to the country six months ago and is studying business at NYU and is a real upstart and ambitious.And my character does nothing because he feels like the world owes him, and of course the world owes him nothing.And it s the juxtaposition of these two roommates that underpins the drama of the play. What I m trying to discuss— and it s something on my mind all the time— is that the guy who comes from Nepal[a character based on a real friend of Eisenberg s] works harder than I do and deserves more than I do, even though I come from a place of greater privilege than him.Just because I was born on third base doesn t mean I get to stay there.…That s what s on my mind all the time. As a Jewish person, it feels like I could have assimilated into white hegemonic culture and be totally comfortable and go out to the Hamptons or go golfing or whatever people do .I don t want to do that because I feel like I will, to quote Woody Allen, ripen and then rot. EK: What are the practices you keep up that keep you from assimilating into that white hegemonic culture ? JE : It s going to sound crazy, but making myself miserable occasionally.We don t go to culture clubs or go on vacation.I m a movie actor; I can certainly afford to take my family on vacation.It s just not in us to go somewhere slightly warm and sit down for a day; it would never occur to us.It s not in our blood. My parents: I want to send them away.My dad is such a hardworking guy who teaches at two universities, who lives in central Jersey and drives to Albany; my mom, who works at a hospital… these are really hardworking, wonderful, bright people in their 60 s who deserve a break.I want to give them a vacation as a successful movie actor, but they d never take it. And so they buy animals— they have several animals in their house— and I always thought, This is what people do when their lives become too comfortable and they re not comfortable with ease: They get an animal. Because an animal can make your life really difficult if you re too old to have a child. They have a parrot that wakes them up at 5 in the morning.Why do they have a parrot at all ? They re animal rights advocates who probably don t even believe parrots should be domesticated.And yet they have a parrot that wakes them up at 5 in the morning that they have to go feed, and then they feed it and it bites their ear.… EK: It feels like this idea that when you have enough, you lose this kind of will to succeed, and that you can lose your spiritual core.…But that sounds like what you re talking about: that you re afraid if you let off the gas a bit, or if Jews let off the gas a bit, they will fall into a spiritual and productive torpor. JE: Yes, I feel that s right.I feel that in a way that s totally unconscious for me. And the most glaring example for that is every day I walk to my theater, the most beautiful in the West End, and there s a big photo of my face and it says it s a triumph and a great play. All I see when I see that image, which I see every day, is terror.How am I going to make sure tonight s audience is going to feel the thing it says on the poster ? I don t feel any satisfaction; I don t feel any glee, or joy, or accomplishment.I feel pure terror.I m not exaggerating— there s no false humility, there s nothing to be humble about this feeling.It s pure terror: It s, How am I going to live up to what I ve promised they re going to be paying for? And I think, in a macro - anthropological way, I m thinking that to keep good at it.Because the moment I think, Oh, it s a triumph; that s great; I don t have to do anything tonight … the moment I have that feeling is the moment the play is no longer good and the moment the play is no longer probing in a way that lives up to the standard I set for myself.In a way it s survival, but it s totally paradoxical— because you re killing yourself in a way to survive.… If we re suddenly let into the golf course, are we going to swing as hard ? Jesse Eisenberg: actor, author, playwright, comedian Eisenberg recommends Patrimony, by Philip Roth, which is about the death of Roth s father. Eisenberg also recommended Ilustrado, a book about the Philippines by Miguel Syjuco, and Woody Allen books in general for their absurdity",

How do you prepare a young daughter for being cat - called ? For being flashed on the subway ? Or for other, subtler, forms of sexism ? We don t have language to explain what that feels like — what that means or what that is, says Jessica Valenti, columnist and Feministing founder. Especially when you re thinking about kids and growing up. On the latest episode of The Ezra Klein Show, Valenti talks about how she s grappled with being treated as a sex object— and the real, psychological impact that has on women across the country. There are researchers who study something called ‘objectification theory, which is the way in which women react to being sexually objectified, Valenti says. And they ve been able to link it to anxiety, depression, psychological distress. These things have tangible impacts. In June, Valenti published Sex Object, a memoir that strings together sometimes painful stories about experiencing sexism.On The Ezra Klein Show(which you can listen to here or subscribe to here), Valenti explains exactly what motivated her when she set out to write it: The best I can hope for is the message I wish I had gotten when I was 15: that the world is messy, and so expect to be a mess yourself. I don t think I was fully prepared for how much I would blame myself for not knowing how to handle a really chaotic world.Things can be really tough for women, but we re meant to live in it and go through it day to day without showing any impact or being worse for the wear— which I don t think is realistic.And I think women carry around a lot of self - doubt and self - hatred for not handling it better, when in fact we should not be handling it.It is terrible, and it s okay to feel really fucked up about it… That s the question I was really trying to get at with my daughter: How do I prepare her for that ? I don t have the language for it.We don t have language to explain what that feels like, what that means, what that is, especially because it is so unrelenting and differs from space to space. It may be easy to say: ‘If you re on the subway, a guy may flash you, and that s going to feel really terrible. But how do you connect that and relate that to looks you ll get or a small comment a teacher might make ? It s really difficult to articulate, especially when you re thinking about kids and growing up. You can find Valenti expounding on what she wishes she could tell her 15 - year - old self in the essay she published in the Guardian. Show notes: Among the other topics discussed on the show: Valenti on understanding the unfairness of sexist dress codes. Fuck the high road: the upside of sinking to their level — a really, really excellent piece by Valenti in the Nation from June 2013 with direct consequence for the podcast interview. The Four Waves of Feminism. Valenti recommended listeners read the book Whipping Girl by Julia Serano. Why Valenti wants Hillary Clinton fans to be okay with supporting her in part because she s a woman. Vox s Emily Crockett on the gendered criticism that Hillary Clinton is shouting too much. Jessica Valenti: founder of Feministing, columnist at the Guardian, author of Sex Object Valenti says there are several books she rereads every year, including Gabriel García Márquez s classic One Hundred Years of Solitude. In terms of books related to feminism, Valenti said Roxane Gay s Bad Feminist is a must-read and that bell hooks s Feminist Theory is a great book to start with for someone new to the world of feminist writing. She also recommended Whipping Girl, by Julia Serano: The book that really changed my thinking on a lot of things...which people should absolutely read, not just because of transgender issues but also for conversations around femininity and what it means in America.",

And his story carries a lot of hope for anyone trying to make it in a creative profession today: it's amazing how little he needed to get started in music, and as he explains, even less is needed now. If you're an aspiring artist, Moby's argument is definitely worth hearing. In his early 20 s, the electronic musician Moby lived in an abandoned factory on Manhattan s Lower East Side.He paid a security guard $50 a month— and not a dime in rent. Everything about it was illegal: It was a firetrap, it didn t have running water, it didn t have a bathroom, who knows how old the wiring was, Moby says in a recent episode of The Ezra Klein Show.(You can listen to Klein and Moby s conversation by streaming it here or by subscribing to the podcast on iTunes.) We were exposed to all sorts of creepy chemicals, which is probably why I m bald today. But if the abandoned factory was dangerous to live in , it also represented an opportunity.Freed of a monthly rent bill, Moby could spend most of his days concentrating almost entirely on his music— an opportunity he now worries is lost for a generation of younger musicians. In his new memoir, Porcelain, Moby looks at what made the New York City of the late 1980 s and early 90s such fertile ground for an explosion of creativity. It s a fascinating question — and the launch point for a broader conversation over housing policy, how fringe culture has evolved, and the right path for aspiring artists just setting out on their careers. A lightly edited section of Moby s interview is transcribed below.Download The Ezra Klein Show today by clicking here. Ezra Klein: Something I thought was fascinating about the book was how it was a story of zoning policy, low rents, and New York City in a very certain period.It really seemed to me that a big part of the way you see your story is what was possible to do inthe low - rent environment of New York City in that era. Does that sound right to you ? Moby : Yeah. Let s say it s late 80s, early 90 s and you re an aspiring musician or director, and you want to live in some crummy, cheap, low-rent urban environment. You had so many places to choose from — you could move to DC, LA, Seattle, London, San Francisco, Paris — all of these inexpensive, rundown urban environments. And I was just feeling a little sad for the young people of today: Where do they go to make art or make music and not have to worry about the rent ? Because I feel almost every urban environment now is prohibitively expensive.... Paying $50 a month to squat in an abandoned factory, or my first apartment in New York, where I paid to live next to a crack den— I don t know where that exists or if that exists. EK: Tell me about your first apartment in New York. Moby: It was on the corner of 14 th and Third.We were on the ground floor, it was a three - bedroom apartment, and it was around $1, 200. And we shared it with three to four people. I had the smallest room, and my windows faced a shaftway that was literally filled with garbage— it had 3 or 4 feet of literally condensed, piled - up garbage.And there s this one story in the book about a drug addict who fell out of the third-story window, and the garbage saved his life. The EMTs came, and they took him away alive; if he had fallen onto a concrete shaftway, he probably would have died, but the fact that there was 3 feet of condensed garbage literally kept him from dying. ... EK: You mentioned the warehouse you lived in before this.A lot of this seemed to be unlawful and in violation of all sorts of health and safety codes. It got me thinking: How much of the regulations we ve put in place to protect people actually end up stifling their ability to get their start ? You made a rational choice to accept worse conditions to be in a place that s more artistically productive. Moby: In the 20 th century, so many rules and regulations were passed with the best intentions, but the rules and bureaucracy take on a life of their own.At one point they re passed to serve the people, and then they just exist to keep civil servants in business. ... I m glad when I was living illegally in a factory that nobody bothered to pay attention.Everything about it was illegal: It was a firetrap, it didn t have running water, it didn t have a bathroom. We were exposed to all sorts of creepy chemicals, which is probably why I m bald today. But at the same time, it enabled me to pay $50 a month to a security guard so I could squat in this abandoned factory and work on music and not have to worry about paying the rent.So I was really grateful to be able to live adjacent to the law. EK: Why did that seem like a good play to you ? When you were thinking about becoming a musician...what was it about that location and the[decisions] you took that were important in your development ? Moby : I come from old New England stock, and the fact that I was living within my means— making $4, 000 a year and paying $50 a month in squatter s rent— there was a sort of Calvinist virtue in that. And I was also really happy there.There s something about this old industrial environment— I had these big windows that faced south, and I didn t have indoor plumbing, and it smell funny, and I was broke, and there were crack addicts — but the light was beautiful and I had free electricity, and it was only $50 a month. The cons were also awful but really fascinating, because they were so foreign to what most of my friends were dealing with.So I sort of loved being the only white person in this neighborhood that was culturally so different from what my friends were dealing with.... EK: When you talk about the low rents of that period, it reminds me of something my colleague Matt Yglesias has written about...something[Yglesias] says in the book is that we have tended to use high crime, high poverty as a kind of affordable housing policy. Do you think there s a way to have the artistic community you really value from that community, absent the substandard living quality that a lot of people suffered from ? Can you recreate that world without the things that kept money out of it and kept the rent so low ? Moby : Yes, and— not to be glib— but I think a lot of that is being facilitated by what s being allowed to be created online. If you were a photographer or filmmaker or author, up until recently you needed to be in a major metropolitan area.You needed to be able to work in recording studios, or get signed to record labels and go on radio stations.But now, because of online access, most people don t need to be anywhere to successfully do their work. So I think a lot of people are compartmentalizing— their work happens online, and where they ll live is for quality of life.A lot of people are moving to upstate New York or Joshua Tree, or places that can afford them a nice quality of life but traditionally wouldn t have been feasible as places to live because they would have been so remote. But now it seems like that has changed. EK: That s really interesting, because I was going to ask: If you were going to start out today, where would you go ? It sounds like you would log on...does that have the leveling effect it sounds like, or are there things lost in day - to - day collaboration of people you can see and meet on the street that you miss ? This sounds more like a cerebral connection between different creators. Moby: And we see the danger of online provincialism in politics— the far left and the far right are so accommodated by where they hang out online.... I think there s a lot to be said for when the media was broader and more roughly ecumenical.When we were all saying essentially same thing and weren t quite as polarized. My friends on the far left, they started to disappear down rabbit holes of obscurity and arcane policy that makes a lot of sense to them because they only talk to each other.It seems really dangerous.And in the world of culture, as well. Now people are only exposed to things presented to them via Facebook.They re not necessarily as exposed to worldviews that might not even be contradictory but might represent something different from their provincial cul - de - sac. EK: On the one hand, it feels like so much of what you valued in the book is the ability to be in niches where folks not represented well in the culture could find their own community...and now, in a way, what you re saying is the internet has made it easy.Far from having to fight for your community, you don t have to fight to be involved. Moby: That worries me, because it pushes people even further to the fringes.I understand the appeal of fringe culture.I say this as a serious vegan: It s nice to hang out with other vegans.... It can be way too insular, and almost tautological, in terms of the messaging people are putting out there and responding to.And then there s the danger of conflation, where you conflate the concerns of your subgroup with the broader concerns of the population. Big thanks to Moby for joining The Ezra Klein Show; you can learn more about his new book, Porcelain, here. Moby: electronic music superstar Moby. The Once and Future King, a fantasy children s classic by T.H. White, and The Journals of John Cheever, which Moby said was critical in helping him write his new memoir, Porcelain. His last pick was Kabir s collected poems: This is really going to prove I m a hippie from Southern California...like Rumi, he s a 13 th - century Iranian Sufi poet.His poetry— there is such a wonderful, joyful, kind spirituality to it.",

Here s what is: Up until recently, employers could use a loophole to keep private the fact that they d paid for these third-party consultants, who would often then appear to the workers as independent authorities on the dangers of unionizing. People are scared to death, oftentimes, because they ll get this parade of horribles about, If they join this union you ll lose your job, you ll lose [your] benefits. And little do they know the company just spent $2 million on the consultant to tell them all these horrific things, says Labor Secretary Thomas Perez on a recent episode of The Ezra Klein Show podcast. Perez, widely floated as a dark horse VP pick for Hillary Clinton, joined Vox s Ezra Klein for a wide-ranging conversation that touched on union organizing, President Barack Obama s economic record, and Perez s childhood in Buffalo, New York. (You can listen to the discussion by subscribing to the podcast or streaming it on SoundCloud or Spotify.) Perez and Klein also talked about the Labor Department s new rule forcing employers to disclose the consultants they ve hired for help fighting unions, and why Perez hopes it will help level the playing field between management and union organizers. We want to make sure that during union organizing campaigns, workers understand the information that s coming at them. There s a whole world of consultants who are out there who advise employers on how to beat back union organizing efforts.… Under the LMRDA— the Labor Management Reporting Disclosure Act— the law calls for disclosure when you have hired one of these union - busting consultants.But there was a loophole employers were driving a mack truck through— so if you re a worker and trying to figure out if you want to join a union, you re getting all the information.And what we re saying [to the businesses], You have to disclose who you hired and how much you paid them. If you can put sunshine out there, it can be a disinfectant.So the purpose of the LMRDA is to level the playing field.Under the status quo, ironically, unions organizing campaigns have significantly greater reporting requirements than the company. The purpose of this is to help people make informed judgments; people are scared to death, oftentimes, because they ll get this parade of horribles about, If they join this union you ll lose your job, you ll lose their benefits. And little do they know the company just spent $2 million on the consultant to tell them all these horrific things. So we re thinking of everything we can do to create a level playing field, because we believe a big problem today is the issue of leverage. Show notes Among the other topics Perez and Klein discussed: The minimum wage, and why Perez doesn t think the Democrats have moved too far to the left on the question The death of Perez s father when Perez was 10, and the role of his surrogate father — a Teamster — in helping raise him Whether America should make increasing the labor force participation rate a critical goal Why Perez defends Obama s economic record The daily routine of a labor secretary(and why Perez gets up at 5: 30 am) What Perez did to dramatically raise employee satisfaction at the Department of Labor Tom Perez: labor secretary, dark horse VP candidate for Hillary Clinton Tom Perez Perez s first recommendation was Malcolm Gladwell s David and Goliath, which Perez said reflected his attention to the fierce urgency of now : It s a story of the folks who overcome a lot of adversity. There s one passage that really resonated with me: There were some people who did exciting and interesting things later in life, and what they had in common was when they were young they had significant personal challenges, like their parents dying and things that were unfortunate. Perez also recommended Daniel Brown s The Boys in the Boat, the Depression - era story of the 1936 gold medal American rowing team, and Doris Kearns Goodwin s No Ordinary Time, which looks closely at the lives of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt during World War II.",

This is one of the most fun conversations I've had for this show. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did. Last year, Andrew Sullivan quit blogging— the medium he had done so much to create. And you know what ? He was pretty damn happy about it.He was taking walks, meditating, exercising, reading, and generally living the good life.Of course, then Donald Trump just had to go and drag him back into the fray. The constant twitchy fascism of the guy just began to penetrate my consciousness, Sullivan says. Sullivan s return came with a blockbuster feature in New York magazine, one we talk about it at length in my new interview with him on The Ezra Klein Show. (You can listen to our discussion by subscribing to my podcast or streaming it on SoundCloud or Spotify.) We also discuss why Sullivan believes in God, what it was like being an HIV - positive writer during the height of the AIDS epidemic, how Sullivan s thinking on Obama has changed since 2008, what led him to fear Donald Trump, why he decided against building the Daily Dish into a larger operation, why he thinks political correctness is toxic to our politics, and much more. Here are a few highlights: On Sullivan s 10-day meditation retreat, and the extreme suffering he experienced in the middle Andrew Sullivan: I took a 10 - day completely silent meditation retreat....I went to the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts, the converted old convent in a beautiful forest. There were 90 people there, and you lived in a dorm— it s a noble silence, meaning you re not allowed to look anybody in the eyes.And no reading is allowed. Ezra Klein: Holy shit. AS: You get up at 5: 30 and you eat— which is for three brief periods a day— and the rest of the time you are either sitting or walking in silent meditation.So you re spending from 5:30 in the morning until 7:30 at night meditating. And 45 of the people there were doing it for three months.And 45 were there for, like, six weeks.And I was snuck in there for about 10 days. All I can tell you is it was extremely grueling. EK: Was this your first meditation retreat of any kind ? AS : Yeah, I went right into the hardcore, and this place is very hardcore, too.I like doing hardcore things, and I m curious what it can really do. I wanted to know how far I could get from blogging. I really thought, I need to detox from this whole crazy machine. And this was one way of doing it. ... It s pretty wonderful, in some ways. And I have a strong, introverted, monastic kind of impulse — which no one really believes, but what is actually kind of true. When you get rid of the distractions we live with every day — every tweet, every news story, everything to eat, every commercial, every face, and every friend — you realize what you ve been distracting yourself from.It takes a few days of just being to come into contact with what you re really feeling. This was a total surprise for me.I thought I was going to go and sit for two days in bliss and just chill, and I was— for about two days.Then I was walking around the forest in silence on the third day, and I was completely overwhelmed by a feeling of —all I can say is extreme suffering.I was taken back to my childhood in a vivid and utterly uncontrollable way.... You wonder if you re going to go crazy because you can t talk to anybody about this.If you were in a normal place and these issues suddenly came up and you felt bad, you d call a friend or you d talk to your husband.But you couldn t go anywhere, and it really forces you there. For some reason my maternal grandmother, my relationship with her, began to revive in my psyche, and that calmed me down.And then I was okay again. What I drew from that, in many ways, was the thought that we do live the way the meditators say: The lives we live are not the ones we think we re living. If we zoom out of that experience and look at contemporary America or the West and you just think, Wow, what an incredible amount of business and distraction that is in fact an entire economy built on top of it. And what is Western humankind really distracting ourselves from something? And you have those kinds of big thoughts when you re out there with nothing else to do. So I think it was a busy if grueling experience. It was a really good thing to do even if it was really rough. ... EK: Ten days after the meditation retreat, were you different in how you went about your day ? Or did you snap back ? AS : It took more than that.There was no point at which I snapped back, because by that point I also had weaned myself off the news. But Trump, goddammit— EK: The opposite of meditation in a human being. AS: The constant twitchy fascism of the guy just began to penetrate my consciousness. I had really hoped to write about other things.The book that I started on is a book about Christianity, and I wanted to shift to write about religion, maybe literature, because 15 years of doing that was mind - blowing in the end. But what are you going to do ?...I realized in February, when my year off was coming to an end, I thought, I really felt this was history and a moment, and you have to stand up and be counted if you want to really do your duty. I don t want to sound noble, but as you can tell from that piece I m truly disturbed by this man.And truly concerned about the culture he s thriving in. Every day when I was blogging all these thoughts I d have about the public wheel I can get rid of , it just built until I thought, I need a place to put this down. On longform, advertising, and the future of the media business EK: I think our media culture is becoming friendlier to longform...insofar as it s friendly to anything, I think it s friendly to longform. On the part of readers, there s a desire to reward effort. I think there s on the part of other writers a lionization of longer, more narrative work. In some ways I think it s very dismissive of blogging, of smart takes, and much unfriendlier to other forms that have become commoditized even though doing those forms is, I think, really difficult. AS: I think that s really changed over the last 15 years. Partly because what the internet allowed you to do was hot takes, what blogging was around the clock, and we were fascinated with it. And let s face it: That s the business model at this point, these huge firehose machines that just churn out little bits and barbs in the hope of getting other people to peddle corporate advertising. I think you might be right.My own sense is that what I want to do now is this longform writing and write books.And I get the sense that books, too, are becoming fashionable again— we had this fantastic new toy, we played around with it in a million different ways, and I think the entire economic model of the web is about to collapse.I think there s a content bubble of massive proportions. EK: I obviously have a lot of motivated reasons to be more optimistic about this, but I go very back and forth on if there s a content bubble and what that ends up meaning. When I got to the Washington Post, they were in their fourth round of layoffs.And every day there was a bell and everyone would gather, and someone would eat cake because they were leaving the institution. I rode up[the elevator] with the managing editor one day and said, It s incredible how much cake you go through here. And he said, Yeah, we ve really had to cut the cake budget recently. I thought, I really got into media at the wrong time. BuzzFeed being profitable but maybe not as profitable as they d hoped to be sounded like a very different situation — and, frankly, a much better one — than the one that was really not that long ago, where nobody was making any money. AS: Yes.But this depends on the fusion of journalism and advertising as a business model.And my contention is that that won t work. I don t think that will work. It will either destroy the brand of the journalism — in which case, advertisers won t be interested— or the truth is that young writers will earn much more money writing corporate propaganda under the guise of writing articles and the journalism stuff will peter out.It s just not cost-effective. I think there s too much stuff for people to try to read, and the ad dollars are so minuscule that you ll get diminishing returns pretty quickly.I haven t dealt with this in terms of developing a business model, but I really think a crash is coming. I think the branding is going to become really hard. EK: I could see two ways that could look, right ? Because if you imagine a crash is coming— one is a crash, what people imagine is that everyone goes down.The other is a consolidation— the tide goes out, and those without a brand or a model end up in a lot of trouble. AS: I think I need to add something: This will work at the expense of text.Writing will become a far tinier portion of web traffic than video. EK: And that s happening. But 20 years ago, when I read magazines, it was clear that more people enjoyed television. It s been true for a long time that more people enjoyed video entertainment over text entertainment... AS: Except video is the only thing that pays any money. In the last 10 years, when the internet was evolving, text and writing suddenly had a huge increase in its reach.And my view is that video will crowd that out and writing will return back to a much more niche situation, and we will return to where we were before without the excitement around writing— as the web becomes basically TV. And I think what s left for writing will be subscription-based, because there are so many other places for people to advertise, and because writing at any serious level drastically reduces the possible levels for readership. The origins of Sullivan s push for same-sex marriage AS: From the 80s on, this was the issue I really wanted to promote. There was a constant conflict about it on the left and the right, and when the decision came down I felt this incredible sense of relief. EK: You were really the first writer to push this in a serious way.What was the background to the first piece you wrote about this ? AS : It was an editorial meeting at the New Republic.Those were the good old days when magazines would be asking, What should we collectively write about this? What s our position? I wasn t on staff at all — I had been back at Harvard working on my dissertation and said at the meeting, Why don t we let everyone get married ? ... Michael Kinsley said, That s a good argument, and I said, Surely that should be the conservative argument. And that was the basic gist, and Mike said, Write that, write that. He kept nagging me, and I said, All right, I ll bash this out. And he put it on the cover. I wasn t even out to my parents at that point. At that time in 1988, if you wrote about gay subjects you had to be gay. No one wrote about them because they didn t want to appear to be gay; they were all written by women or gay men.... It was regarded as an interesting, classic New Republic contrarian, silly, rhetorical, stick it to the right argument.That s how most people saw it. But when I thought about it some more, I realized, No, I ve absolutely stumbled onto something important. The book that really affected me was John Boswell s book, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality — it s an amazing book because it was the first that really advanced the idea that gay people have really existed forever, and have in the past constructed forms of relationship that were stabled and enduring.That was exciting to find that was going on in the eighth century, to discover we re not doing something new. And then it got fused with the AIDS epidemic, because I saw people who had taken care of their spouses for years denied access to their apartments, not allowed into their funerals....Gay people today could not believe what these people went through, because we didn t have basic protections. Then my best friend died.And I also felt I was going to die.So I thought, I have to write something soon about marriage equality. Andrew Sullivan: former New Republic editor, founder of the Dish, famous essayist TJ Kirkpatrick / Getty Images Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality, by John Boswell: It s an amazing book, because it was the first that really advanced the idea that gay people have really existed forever, and have in the past constructed forms of relationship that were stabled and enduring. That was exciting to find that was going on in the eighth century, to discover we re not doing something new. Sullivan also touted The Confessions of St.Augustine— it was almost as if this man were born today and yet is seeing the world through a different lens — and Michel de Montaigne s Selected Essays as the other essential component to a civilized person s reading material. Sullivan rounded out the list with George Orwell s collected essays and T.S.Eliot s Collected Poems",

It s a helluva career. I spoke with Rivlin on the latest episode of The Ezra Klein Show.You can stream the interview live and for free on SoundCloud here, or subscribe to the podcast on iTunes or Spotify.Among the topics: Why she became an economist in the first place How economists think about problems How a sexist senator almost blocked her appointment to the Congressional Budget Office, and how an angry stripper saved her nomination What the Congressional Budget Office does, and why it s so quietly powerful What she s learned working with Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Paul Ryan, and Barack Obama Whether economics has lost its ability to answer the big questions Whether Obamacare s insurance exchanges are working How to make service sector jobs pay better Here s Rivlin, for instance, on how our tools for studying public policy s impact have dramatically improved over time— even if that hasn t necessarily translated into better policy itself. When I first came to Washington I first worked in the Johnson administration. There, in the late 60s we were sending a slew of bills to the Congress often without any analysis of what they might cost in the long run, what the effects might be; the idea you could attach credible numbers to these things were very new. I think[our policymaking] is more informed but not necessarily better.The problem is now we re not making much policy at all because our political system has become so polarized that there s almost nothing our two parties can agree on, especially in an election year.But if they do talk about what they can do on some big issue— investment infrastructure, for instance— they will have at their disposal much better information about what things will cost and what taxes would have to change to pay for it.... Medicare seemed like a good idea after many years of trying on the part of the liberals to cover all seniors with a public health insurance plan.Nobody had a really good idea what it would cost; it just seemed like a good idea whose time had come, and they had the votes to pass it.It turned out to be much more expensive than anybody thought, and over the years adjustments were made in various ways.But I think you could argue that if anybody knew what Medicare would cost it wouldn t have passed. As always, there s much more in the interview. If you re interested in how policy is really made in Washington, you should listen to this conversation. Alice Rivlin: queen of the Washington budget wonks Rivlin recommended two books by social scientist Daniel Yankelovich— Coming to Public Judgment, which is about how the public makes decisions, and The Magic of Dialogue. Rivlin also recommended Northwestern University professor Robert Gordon s The Rise and Fall of American Growth, though— like Bill Gates— she disagrees with its conclusion: I don t think he s necessarily right about the future. I don t know if we know how to predict productivity change, but it s very interesting. ... It s a very well-researched history book, where I part company with Robert Gordon on the prediction of what will happen because economists have a very poor track record on predicting technological change.",

Reich is, as you'll hear, an incredible storyteller, a sharp thinker, and a very fun guy to talk to Robert Reich isn t naive about changing America s political system, and he s no conspiracy theorist about Hillary Clinton. Now a public policy professor at the University of California Berkeley, Reich worked with Clinton in college, was close friends with Bill Clinton at Oxford, and served as secretary of labor during Clinton s first term.He s also become Bernie Sanders s most persuasive— and, through his Facebook videos, viral— surrogate. Reich isn t a Bernie-or-bust type. Hillary Clinton, he says, is the best possible president for running the system we have. But Sanders, he argues, is the only presidential candidate actually trying to change the system we have into the system we deserve. Reich thinks that our old models for understanding politics have been broken by rising inequality over the past few decades, and that we first need to tackle that crisis head on before we can even get to questions of policy. I recently interviewed Reich for my podcast(you can listen to it here or subscribe on iTunes), and I think it s worth paying attention to why he thinks Sanders is the necessary solution — even if you prefer Clinton. Here s Reich: It s not enough to talk about good policy. Policy is cheap — at least, policy discussion is cheap. I m as much of a policy wonk as anybody; I ve been teaching public policy for 40 years. But it s becoming increasingly irrelevant, because without political will and political power— and a movement behind that political will and power— no policy is going to be put into effect. If you came to the political understanding in the 60s or 70 s or 80s ... the assumption was that politics was laid out on a long continuum from left to right. Democrats were on the left, Republicans were on the right, and the center was the center — and you wanted to go to the center, because that s where all the votes were. That was the way we thought about politics, but that left out some very important phenomena that have occurred over the last several decades.What it leaves out is this widening inequality— it s not just economic, it s also political, and it has to do with political power.The vast majority of Americans, according to almost every study on this issue, feel a high degree of powerlessness.They just feel like they don t have any say, any control. ... The left-right continuum is beside the point. The real interesting divide is establishment versus anti-establishment: Do you feel the game is against you? Or are you among the riggers of the game? Even if you don t agree with Reich s thoughts on the race, I think you ll find our 100-minute interview worthwhile. Reich has a stunningly impressive CV— Rhodes scholar, assistant to US Solicitor General Robert Bork, director of policy planning at the Federal Trade Commission under President Jimmy Carter, co - founder of the American Prospect— and we had no shortage of things to discuss. Among the other topics Reich and I touched on: His early relationship with the Clintons, including the time he went on a date with Hillary Clinton His effort to create an experimental, participatory alternative to college at Dartmouth The three policies he would change first to curb inequality The story behind his co - founding of the American Prospect— the magazine that gave me my first job in journalism What Bernie Sanders is like in person, and how that does or doesn t differ from his public persona His time working for the arch - conservative legal theorist Robert Bork How to communicate effectively about public policy Whether inequality or political polarization is the root cause of government dysfunction His relationship with his mentor, John Kenneth Galbraith Robert Reich: UC Berkeley public policy professor, former secretary of labor, prominent Bernie Sanders surrogate robert reich moveon (MoveOn.org) John Kenneth Galbraith s The Affluent Society: Galbraith was very tall, 6 - foot - 7, and we used to walk along the streets of Cambridge, Massachusetts, together....He had an extraordinary memory— he could remember details from 30 or 40 or 50 years before, and he was very funny and very playful and a very good friend. Galbraith was not doing mathematical economics; he scorned the direction the economics profession was moving[ in ] because he felt the mathematical models couldn t adequately portray the set of institutions and sociological phenomenon that underline economics. Galbraith looked to the social reality— he was as much of a sociologist and political scientist as an economist, and one of the reasons I was so influenced by him is because you can t really understand economics without understanding sociology. Reich also recommended Adam Smith s Theory of Moral Sentiments and Thorstein Veblen s 1899 treatise The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions.",

      "description": "When I first met Bruce Friedrich, he was running PETA's awareness campaigns. Yeah, those campaigns — the ones where naked people stuffed themselves in saran wrap and cages, and where wounded chickens limped outside KFCs.He was also one of the smartest, most informed, and most thoughtful experts I'd found on animal suffering. He had immersed himself in a subject most of us — myself very much included — would prefer to ignore, and he had learned some surprising things, including that vegetarianism was probably worse for animal welfare than cutting out eggs but keeping beef.Since then, Friedrich has become director of the Good Food Institute, as well as a founding partner in New Crop Capital, an investment fund that backs companies creating alternatives to animal-based protein. In this podcast, we talk at length about:- Why you can't trust the humane labels on eggs- Friedrich's path to becoming a food-tech investor- Why Bill Gates and the Google founders are investing in lab-grown meat- How the market for plant-based proteins has changed- Why the all-or-nothing frame around vegetarianism is counterproductive- Why eating eggs is much worse for animal suffering than eating beef- Whether we can really solve global warming without looking at our food choicesAnd, of course, much more.

This was, for me, a fascinating conversation that is already changing the way I eat. I hope it does the same for you. You go to the supermarket to buy some eggs, and see that some are marked have a logo marking them as certified humane. For a well - intentioned consumer strapped for time, this seems like a helpful shorthand— an easy way to ensure that the eggs you re buying come from chickens that weren t raised in appalling conditions.It s certainly a shorthand I used. But it turns out that all humane certifications aren t created equal, or even close to it. I recently had Bruce Friedrich, executive director of The Good Food Institute, on my podcast for an interview(which you can listen to by subscribing to my podcast or streaming it on SoundCloud).Fredrich dismissed the idea that these labels couldbe trusted: There have been multiple undercover investigations by Mercy for Animals, PETA, and other organizations have actually gone into these farms— and it is about the furthest thing you can imagine from humane. Probably the most stark thing it allows that people are shocked by is caging hens.So you have Walmart, and McDonalds, and Costco and all these huge producers saying: We re going to get hens out of cages; we recognize that our consumers don t want it; we recognize it s just horrible animal welfare to cram hens into these cages where they can t move all their lives. The American Humane Association has been on the front lines defending bigger cages— where the animals still can t do anything that s natural to them, and they spend their entire lives unable to move. Friedrich s right: Several investigations have found that eggs with the humane certification come from chickens who spend their entire lives in a space smaller than a square foot, as the Washington Post reported in 2014. And for every chicken that s laying eggs, there s also a male chicken … who was thrown alive into either a grinder or a plastic bag, which is a pretty awful way to go, Friedrich says. It s basically tossing the male babies into garbage disposals. Other humane certifications are more reliable, he explained, but you really need to know which one is which. Friedrich and I spent more than an hour talking about a broad range of topics, including: Friedrich s time running the awareness campaigns for PETA. (Yeah, those campaigns — the ones where naked people stuffed themselves in Saran Wrap and cages.) How PETA comes up with its ideas for its campaigns.(Friedrich compared PETA s brainstorming sessions to the meetings of conservative activist Grover Norquist, another guest on The Ezra Klein Show.) New Crop Capital, Friedrich s venture firm, and its strategy for investing in businesses that can both cut animal suffering and make a profit. Why Bill Gates and the Google founders are investing in lab - grown meat.Why eating eggs is much worse for animal suffering than eating beef.How the market for plant - based proteins has changed.Why the all - or - nothing frame around vegetarianism is counterproductive.Whether we can really solve global warming without looking at our food choices. Bruce Friedrich: executive director of the Good Food Institute, animal rights advocate A laboratory might be more environmentally friendly for growing meat than a cow is. Shutterstock Friedrich recommends Influence: Science and Practice, by Robert Cialdini, for the degree to which it challenges the cognitive dissonance essential to all of our lives : It s a whole bunch of really interesting studies about things, like: If the light turns green and you re behind a VW Bug or behind a Lexus, 100 percent of people say they ll honk at the Lexus first or it s equal. But in test results, 90 percent of people honk at the VW Bug and give the Lexus a pass. If someone asks for a quarter, and they look like you, you re nine times out of 10 more likely to lend them a quarter— even though most of us will say they absolutely won t. Friedrich also suggested Jonathan Safran Foer s Eating Animals and David Allen s Getting Things Done",

The most important article you write on your blog is the second article someone reads ... If that next article is also really good, then you ve established something meaningful with that reader. You have the inkling of a relationship. — Ben Thompson Since launching Stratechery in 2013 from his home in Taiwan, Ben Thompson has established himself as one of the smartest and most thoughtful analysts at the intersection of media, business, and technology. Just as impressive: Thompson has also figured out a way to turn Stratechery into a viable business; his one - man operation operation were earning more than $200, 000 in annual revenue by January 2015. Thompson is coy about the number now, but it s safe to assume it s considerably higher. So getting to geek out with Thompson on the state of the media business is a lot of fun.In the latest edition of my podcast, (which you can listen to by subscribing to my podcast or streaming it on SoundCloud), we talked about a number of topics close to my heart, including: Whether you can still make it as an individual blogger— Ben is showing you can, but the path has really changed; Why Ben s background as a Christian conservative who was the only person around who loved technology has helped him as a tech analyst; Ben s time working for Apple and Microsoft and what he learned about both companies and their cultures; Why the Innovator s Dilemma is worth reading even if you think you already know what it says; How to make money as a modern media company, and why it s easiest for very small sites or very big ones; How to manage the the time-mismatch between writers and their readers on the web; Why good bloggers often repeat themselves so much, and the importance of exposing your mental models to your audience; Why so few companies advertise on podcasts; And much, much more. This is a particularly great episode if you re in new media, or thinking of getting into it, or just want to understand the business dynamics behind the content you consume. There s a lot of advice here that I wish I had known when I started as a journalist. A big thanks again to Thompson for taking so much time for this conversation.",

There isn t anything you can do about tomorrow. There isn t anything you can do about next week. But there s no limit to what you can do to affect the world 25 years from now. The lever that allows you to move the world is time. — Grover Norquist This is an interview listeners of my podcast have been asking for since the first episode. Grover Norquist is the head of Americans for Tax Reform, the creator of the no new taxes pledge that virtually every Republican officeholder has signed, and the founder of the Wednesday meetings that bring together basically every group of note on the American right.Newt Gingrich has called him the single most effective conservative activist in the country. MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnell called him the most powerful man in America who does not sleep in the White House. You may disagree with Norquist s politics, or think that his no tax policy has put a straitjacket on the Republican Party. But even if you do, that makes it more — not less — important to try to understand how he thinks about influencing the American political system. I recently sat down with Norquist for a little more than an hour for the latest episode of The Ezra Klein Show.(You can listen to our discussion by subscribing to my podcast or streaming it on SoundCloud.) Among the topics we touched on: How Norquist came up with his no tax pledge as a 12 - year - old coming home on the bus Norquist s time in Angola and Mozambique helping anti-communist rebels Whether the rise of Donald Trump shows the Republican base isn t quite as committed to small government and low taxes as conservatives hoped. Why Norquist thinks Silicon Valley will eventually turn Republican, and what he s doing to make it happen The maximum percentage of GDP that the US government can spend effectively, according to Norquist That time Norquist did standup comedy at Burning Man What books he recommends, including Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay A big thanks to Norquist for taking so much time for this conversation. Grover Norquist: president of Americans for Tax Reform, author of the anti - tax pledge Grover Norquist Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, by Charles Mackay: It s written in the 1840s going back to the runup on the price of tulips, to witches, to crusades, to riots over the prices of tickets in the theater in London — where people go mad over various things, and over some period of time. That s always a fun one; I like to reread that. Norquist also recommends The Road to Serfdom, the classic economic treatise by Friedrich Hayek, and the murder mystery series Roma Sub Rosa, by Steven Saylor, which take place in Julius Caesar s Rome.",

      "description": "Neera Tanden is CEO of the Center for American Progress — perhaps the most influential left-leaning think tank in Washington. Before that, though, she was the policy director for both Hillary Clinton's Senate office and 2008 campaign, as well as a senior advisor to the Department of Health and Human Services during the drafting of Obamacare. She s also someone many of you requested to hear on the program.Neera Tanden has had a unique vantage point on the Democratic frontrunner. Tanden is a Hillary supporter and a strong one, but she's worked for Clinton for a long time, and so has a perspective on her former boss that most people don't get to see. And that's something I'm interested in. There is, I think it's fair to say, a wide gap between Clinton's reputation as a campaigner as a politician and her reputation as a boss and colleague. And it's that gap that I Tanden is able to shine some light on. Among the topic we cover are:- What it was like for Tanden growing up on welfare, and whether she thinks welfare reform was good for the poor- How she met Hillary Clinton, and why she initially thought of herself as a Bill Clinton person. - Why Clinton's public reputation confuses Tanden- Whether Washington is governed more by individuals or structural forces- What she thinks of criticisms of Clinton's speeches to Goldman Sachs- Why she thinks money has a more poisonous influence in Congress than in the White House- What her favorite think tank papers on both the left and the right are- What policy books she thinks everyone should readTanden is a Hillary Clinton supporter, and a proud one. And in this podcast, she talks about what it's like to actually work for and with Clinton. ",
      "content": "Neera Tanden is CEO of the Center for American Progress — perhaps the most influential left-leaning think tank in Washington. Before that, though, she was the policy director for both Hillary Clinton's Senate office and 2008 campaign, as well as a senior advisor to the Department of Health and Human Services during the drafting of Obamacare. She s also someone many of you requested to hear on the program.Neera Tanden has had a unique vantage point on the Democratic frontrunner. Tanden is a Hillary supporter and a strong one, but she's worked for Clinton for a long time, and so has a perspective on her former boss that most people don't get to see. And that's something I'm interested in. There is, I think it's fair to say, a wide gap between Clinton's reputation as a campaigner as a politician and her reputation as a boss and colleague.

And in this podcast, she talks about what it's like to actually work for and with Clinton. You think history is made of broad forces in the world, and that s how we get significant change. But the reality is that policy is determined by a bunch of people, sitting around a table, making decisions. — Neera Tanden Neera Tanden is president of the Center for American Progress, arguably the most influential liberal think tank in the country.She has also worked extensively with Hillary Clinton, serving as policy director both in Clinton s Senate office and her presidential campaign. On the latest episode of The Ezra Klein Show, I sat down with Tanden, who supports Clinton, to learn more about a side of the candidate that will be important if she wins the White House but is mostly opaque to those of us watching the campaign: What is Hillary Clinton like to work for ? What is her management style ? How does she choose the people around her ? How does her approach to the day - to - day work of politics differ from that of other leading Democratic politicians ? You can listen to our discussion by downloading the podcast or streaming it on SoundCloud. Here are a few of the other topics I cover with Tanden: How growing up on welfare and in a Section 8 apartment influenced Tanden s political philosophy today Why Tanden initially thought she was a Bill Clinton person, not a Hillary Clinton person The reason internal disagreements among Clinton advisers so often spill out into the open Tanden s view of the ways that sexism and gender stereotypes have hurt Clinton s reputation over time Why Tanden thinks criticisms of Clinton s speaking fees, which I echo in the podcast, are unfair How the role of think tanks like CAP has evolved Tanden s favorite policy papers from both sides of the aisle Which policy questions get less attention than they should Neera Tanden: president of the Center for American Progress, a left - wing think tank The Unwinding, by George Packer: It tells the story of the economy and how it s changed — rising inequality through the perspective of four-plus lives. But I think it really tells you a lot about what s happening in this election cycle over the last several years because of the economic changes people are experiencing. Tanden also recommended Why Nations Fail, by James Robinson.",

Really good cooks never learn how to be great chefs. The road is littered with bodies and bodies of great, great cooks who could never become great chefs. Cooking is about failure — over and over and over again. ... For me, the right amount of talent is: barely enough. — David Chang David Chang is one of the most successful restaurateurs in America: His Momofuku restaurant group has become a sprawling empire with locations all over the world, a series of successful cookbooks, and even its own R & D kitchen.Chang has also been behind some of the biggest food trends in recent decades: He s the one who put ramen on your corner, pork belly in every fancy restaurant, and bagel bombs in your coffee shop. Chang is also just a witty, insightful, profane quote machine, and you can listen to our discussion by subscribing to my podcast or streaming it on SoundCloud.Here is— excuse the pun— a small taste of the topics we touched on: How Chang hired his first chefs at a time when no one wanted to work for him The reason spending even two weeks more in one of New York City s best restaurants might have ruined his career Why Chang is skeptical that big farms can raise animals humanely On why aging cooks are like aging athletes. Your body breaks down. There s no way I can do what I did when I was in my early 20s, Chang says. His hilarious story of going to a wedding where some vegetarians insisted on eating asparagus from Peru even though the main course was local lobster. I told them: What the fuck are you guys doing? There s no carbon footprint, and yet you refuse to eat this, he says. To me, it doesn t make any sense. The reason Chang s R&D lab is entirely vegan even though his restaurants are temples for carnivores On the fact that Chang has up to 30 minutes every day where he doesn t want to do his job. I think it s a misconception to say if you love what you do, you love it all the time, he says. That s fucking a total lie. Why Chang, though liberal, fears the unintended consequences of New York raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The wages are really going to cut into the margins. And I think the next two years are going to be very telling about the future of the culinary industry, he says. Why chickpeas are a flavor goldmine How Korean nuns made the best potato chips Chang ever tasted. It s like the best Pringle you ve ever had; they slice these potatoes, then wash them thoroughly to wash the starch out, and then these old ladies ... put the slice of potato on the roof, letting them bake out in the sun. And then when you fry it — it s the craziest thing, I can t even describe to you. And that s what all of their food is like. How an advanced logic class Chang took in college has helped him run his restaurant David Chang: founder & owner of Momofuku Restaurant Group The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right, by Atul Gawande: The best part is when he s talking about Walmart during Hurricane Katrina. That book is really about hubris, I think — you think you re good enough at something, but how do you empower people to make decisions ? The Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Hindu text : Which is a ridiculous thing to say, but I always turn to it because it s about decision-making, but also about indecision in the presence of the worst decision, which is basically genocide. ... I don t know how it comforts me, but when I have a tough decision I think: What is the worst possible thing that could happen? Chang also recommended Douglas Hofstadter s Pulitzer Prize–winning Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, about logic, intelligence, and decision-making.",

Oh, and Ezra gives Booker some advice on productivity apps, drawn from the weird, possibly wrongheaded, way he lives his own life. I ve found divinity in places where people wouldn t normally see it. I ve found magic. … If we see no angels, it s because we harbor none. I like to be able to see the divinity and the angelic nature of humanity. If we see that more, it becomes real, it becomes true. — Cory Booker US Sen.Cory Booker doesn t sound like most other elected officials. He speaks easily and eagerly about the spiritual dimension of government.He says fasting for 10 days and then smelling— yes, smelling— a political rival freed me from the prison of circumstance that so contorted my feelings. He notes with pride that he s the only vegan in Congress. He is quick to talk about his own faults, failings, and shortcomings. Faith necessitates humility — you re actually grappling with conceptions of the divine, and that is uncapturable. It is the infinite, and you re just a finite set trying to comprehend the infinite, Booker says. I recently hosted Booker on my podcast for a 105 - minute conversation that ranged from how Booker s faith influences his politics to productivity apps to his thoughts on Ta-Nehisi Coates. (You can listen to our discussion by subscribing to my podcast or streaming it on SoundCloud.) Among the (many, many) topics we covered: The remarkable story of how Booker s parents used a sting operation to prove that a real estate agent wouldn t sell them a house in a white suburb How Booker s parents were constantly pulling [him] back and forth over the American color line, and what impact that had on Booker s upbringing and worldview Booker s prom night, on which he had to pretend a friend was taking his white date to avoid arousing the suspicion of the girl s parents How Booker came to realize, with the help of Henry Louis Gates, that he is the descendant of both slaves and slave owners What it s like to be the only vegan in Congress Why Booker would rather be described as a hopeful politician than an optimistic one On why Booker did not mock Sen.James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, after Inhofe brought a snowball to the floor of Congress to demonstrate that climate change was not real. I wanted to not accentuate my differences with Sen. Inhofe; I wanted to see him for his humanity and get to know him as a person, Booker says. Why Booker hates penguins Which book Booker gave to every single sitting US senator Underlying much of our conversation is Booker s new book, United: Thoughts on Finding Common Ground and Advancing the Common Good. I highly recommend it. Cory Booker: US senator, former Newark mayor, Rhodes scholar The Fire Next Time, by James Baldwin: I think the last page of that book should be required reading in literature.[Baldwin] was actually criticized for how he ended the book because the book was so raw, honest— and people said he was too Pollyanna - ish at the end. [Baldwin] says: I know what I m asking you is impossible, but in today s day and age, the impossible is the least we can demand from each other. And one is, after all, emboldened by the spectacle of human history and American negro history is a perpetual testimony to the achievement of the impossible. I love how he talks about love, and he earned the right to talk about love in a way that can t then be diminished. It s powerful. Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth, by Mahatma Gandhi: The subtitle is My Experiments With Truth ; there s something that always got me. [Gandhi] is not saying, This is the way and the truth and the life ; he s like, I ve been working at this. I ve been trying to get it right to figure out a way, and in many ways I became a vegetarian as an experiment. ... If we re given 80, 90, 100 years— why don t we just experiment and try something different? I just love this idea of experimenting with truth. Booker also recommended Ta - Nehisi Coates s The Beautiful Struggle and Michelle Alexander s The New Jim Crow",

There s plenty of money in the world; it s just not going to health care for poor people. — Dr.Jim Yong Kim As president of the World Bank, Dr.Jim Yong Kim now oversees 15, 000 employees responsible for using about $200 billion in loans to lift as many people out of global poverty as possible. It s an enormous task. But it s also one that Kim has been thinking about since he founded Partners in Health, a radical health care project in Haiti that revolutionized the way we treat the world s poor (and was immortalized in Tracy Kidder s book Mountains Beyond Mountains). I recently interviewed Kim for my podcast, and it was a delight.Kim has kept the public intellectual s habit of saying interesting things about an almost endless number of topics rather than the bureaucrat s tendency to say dull things about a very narrow band of issues.You can listen to the conversation by subscribing to my podcast or streaming it on SoundCloud.Here s a small sampling of the topics we touched on in our interview: The racial discrimination Kim faced growing up in a small Iowa town. The kids at the day care center I used to go to used to call me Flat-Face — literally slapped me across the face and called me Flat Face, Kim says. What it was like, as a 12 - year - old, to go to an antiwar rally in the early 1970 s with his mom and friends. Everyone had long hair; everyone was smoking pot everywhere, Kim says. To listen to George McGovern talk about the war was just a great experience. What Kim learned studying the sale of bears gallbladders in South Korea. How the critiques of authenticity by French poststructuralist philosophers like Jacques Derrida helped play a transformational role in Kim s life. What he realized when he idealistically returned to South Korea as an adult, only to find out they didn t actually need his help. How he and Paul Farmer met, and why their partnership was so successful. How Kim manages a 15, 000 - person organization with staff scattered all over the world and speaking dozens of different languages. The importance of Catholic liberation theology, particularly that articulated by Brazilian Paulo Freire in Pedagogy of the Oppressed, in influencing the thinking of Kim and Farmer, his colleague. Why Kim loves the raunchy crime yarns of Florida chronicler Carl Hiaasen, author of Striptease. A big thanks again to Kim for taking so much time for this conversation. Dr. Jim Yong Kim: president of the World Bank, former president of Dartmouth College Orientalism, by Edward Said: It was really powerful, in that it helped me understand that all the reactions I had been receiving since I was a little kid reading about how the World Bank said Korea was hopeless in the 1960 s.That was part of a discourse that said more about the people who were involved in that discourse than what was happening on the ground. The Miracle of Mindfulness, by Thich Nhat Hanh: It was given to me by mother....[Hanh] talked about the importance of meditation and being mindful.The truly astounding thing is that the science has caught up with what we thought were the benefits of meditation. We always knew there was something biological about it, but the evidence is now overwhelming. Books in general by Carl Hiaasen, author of Strip Tease and Stormy Weather: I love Carl Hiaasen books....He was an environmentalist before it was cool.He writes raunchy, humorous books, and it s all about awful people in Florida who happen to destroy the environment.",

The polymathic Microsoft founder now leads the world's largest and most important private foundation, and he's predicting that we're on the cusp of the energy breakthrough that's going to save the world. He also talks about the controversial idea that technological innovation is slowing down, assesses how close we are to true artificial intelligence, and explains why you really want to save being sick for 20 years from now. ",

And why are those things gone? It educates you about instruments of torture and how demand for those things seems to have fallen off.It s a pretty profound thing that looks at the rate of violence over history, and Pinker tries to look into it: Why have we been able to achieve that? Why, when you re dealing with lots of strangers, has the violent death rate come down so dramatically ? What is it about morals, taboos, systems of laws ? Gates also recommended Sapiens : A Brief History of Humankind, by Yuval Harari, and Seveneves, a very clever science fiction book by Neal Stephenson",

      "description": "When the New York Times profiled Tony Podesta, the headline was simply: Tony Podesta, superlobbyist. Podesta is head of the Podesta group, and considered by many to be the most powerful, or at least one of the most powerful, lobbyists in Washington. Companies turn to him in their greatest time of need — he represented BP after the oil spill, and Bank of America after the financial crisis. Lobbying is not exactly the most popular profession. And yet, DC is full of lobbyists — they're a genuinely important part of how decisions get made, of how information is spread, of what policies end up happening. Podesta explains what it's like to be a lobbyist, what he actually does during the day, and in a world where his profession is a bit of a dirty word, why it feels to him like a good thing to do. It's an illuminating conversation about a profession that's widely loathed, incredibly important, and frequently misunderstood.",

But Maddow took a winding path to cable news — a path that included scheming to disrupt skinhead rallies, radical AIDS activism at the height of the plague, a gig as a sidekick on drive-time morning radio, and a stint at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar (where she, um, may have temporarily borrowed some very rare books). In this conversation, we talk about that path— as well as her favorite graphic novels, the best time to neuter a dog, her belief that Bill Clinton should have resigned over the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and why she tries to avoid reading op - ed columns.She also gives the single best description of what activism is— and what it isn t — that I ve ever heard. Not convinced to download the whole thing yet ? Here are some highlights : 1) On Maddow s strategy for disrupting skinhead protests in high school: At one point, we went to Oakland to a meeting of the anti-racist skins ... and asked them to go to one of the white power concerts where the skinheads from our town were going to be — to ask them to please beat up the racist skinheads. 2) On activism as a math problem: What I tried to do as an activist was to approach each thing I wanted to get as a math problem. So, here s a thing that I think should be different in the world: I want people who are dying of AIDS in prisons to be allowed to die in secure hospices rather than dying in jail infirmaries. That s what I want. Me just saying that and expressing the moral righteousness of that is not enough. Who is the person who can decide to make that happen? The hospices need to be good with it, so, okay, let s go to the hospices. Who is the person who makes the decision about who goes to the hospices? Well, there s a category of decision-making here that is for people who do not have life sentences; they re susceptible to these kinds of decision-makers. And then there s a whole another category of decision-makers who say as a matter of policy ... so let s change the local decision-makers; now let s change the law. And just doing it piece by piece by piece, why won t this law change? Because the committee chairman who is responsible for this as an issue doesn t care about this. What does he care about? He cares about golf. Okay, let s find whoever he golfs with s wife, and find who his pastor is and talk to her about this. 3) On Pat Buchanan s unexpectedly crucial role in her career: It s the George W.Bush reelection effort, and so every cable news Punch and Judy show in the world is looking for liberals to fight with conservatives.So I was getting paired up with G.Gordon Liddy and Pat Buchanan. Pat Buchanan really helped me. He said, after I got booked opposite him on some show, he said to the producers: Hey, I like that liberal girl. Have her come on with me more. He was very sweet to me. 4) On why she doesn t read opinion columns while preparing for her show: I try really, really hard to avoid all opinion. I don t read columns....Sometimes you get an op - ed that s actually introducing a ton of new information. I don t want to absorb other people s opinions, and I don t want to become[part of ] a tide of common wisdom on something. 5) On why Bill Clinton should have stepped down over the Lewinsky scandal: I think Bill Clinton should have resigned the presidency because of his sexual impropriety with an intern. ... I think that s not a popular view, but because it was somebody who was in his employ — it was wrong enough that it was an affront to his presidency. I think Al Gore probably would have been a fine president. I think that Bill Clinton was, to the extent that he carried out his responsibilities as president, he sort of did fine. But the damage done to expectations, both of behavior and accountability — I think specifically because of the sexual misconduct — it s hard to quantify, but I feel that way. You can listen to the whole conversation with Rachel Maddow— and subscribe to all future conversations— on iTunes. Rachel Maddow: host of MSNBC s The Rachel Maddow Show Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power, by Steve Coll: It changed my thinking about big corporations and, particularly, their relationship to politics.The way Exxon looks at not just who is the president and who is in Congress, but the way Exxon looks at the global map and the divisions between where countries are and says: We will outlast this map. Governments will come and go, but we, Exxon, will have needs and desires and things we want to do that transcend the coming and going of countries and governments. Lessons in Disaster: McGeorge Bundy and the Path to War in Vietnam, by Gordon Goldstein: A brilliant book of the rationality of that terrible decision[the Vietnam War]— how each incrementally more terrible decision made sense, as you were going step by step. It wasn t a conspiracy; it wasn t a cabal.It wasn t bad people trying to get bad things done; it was people with understandable faults, emotions, and assets making decisions that made sense in the moment, that led to something terrible without there being any sort of organizational break. The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, by Naomi Klein: If you are not caught up in a crisis and you instead are one of the people standing back and thinking how this crisis is going to ultimately benefit you...that is a perspective worth anticipating— seeing crises not just for who creates them but who can benefit from them",
